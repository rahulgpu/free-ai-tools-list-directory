  "description": "ZeroClaw is a fast, modular autonomous AI agent infrastructure with pluggable components for building custom agent workflows. ZeroClaw is a next-generation autonomous AI agent framework from ZeroClaw Labs that emphasizes modularity and performance. Unlike OpenClaw's monolithic approach, ZeroClaw uses a pluggable component architecture where each capability is an independent module. This makes it easier to customize, extend, and audit. Highlights: Modular pluggable architecture. Fast lightweight core. Easy to extend. Clean separation of concerns. Open-source.",
