            <h2>About Soon app</h2>
            <p>Soon is a fully automated crypto investing tool that allows users to invest in cryptocurrency without the stress of speculating. The platform uses dollar-cost averaging to invest, meaning users do not need to decide when to buy or sell. Soon also provides a standard portfolio, eliminating the need for users to spend hours researching what to buy. The tool is designed to take advantage of micro-opportunities provided by cryptocurrency through short-term volatility, buying often and selling often during small and large price upswings, taking smaller gains more frequently that add up over time. When users spend, Soon is notified and sells their highest gains to cover the transaction. Soon transfers money from the user's bank to invest in crypto and transfers earnings back to their bank weekly. With every gain sold, Soon sets a portion aside in a Tax Stash to cover the user's capital gains taxes. Soon has a strict 1 to 1 custody policy, which means that for every cryptocurrency denomination presented in the app, that exact amount is held in the user's wallet. The tool is safe, secure, and ethical, with assets held solely in the US, meeting all regulatory requirements.</p>
