            <p>CrowdPrisma is an AI-powered survey analysis engine that can help users identify subgroups of respondents and meaningful signals in free-text responses at a significantly faster pace than traditional manual analysis. The tool uses cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze thousands of free-text responses and group them into topics automatically, with succinct summaries provided for easy interpretation. The interactive dashboard feature allows users to explore and analyze any subset of respondents, providing insights into how different questions are related to each other. CrowdPrisma's AI engine reads through and analyzes survey results in an intuitive and engaging way. By identifying subgroups of respondents who think similarly, CrowdPrisma discovers the key topics they talk about. This feature helps users save time as analysis that previously took weeks can now be done in less than an hour. CrowdPrisma's pricing model offers a free trial, which includes one survey, ten questions, two hundred participants, and access to all of the tool's features. The beta testing program provides a 25% discount on the first year's bill for those who participate. In summary, CrowdPrisma is a powerful and innovative survey analysis tool that leverages AI and NLP to help users discover meaningful insights in the responses of their target audience, allowing for better and faster decision-making.</p>
