            <p>Context Clue is an AI-powered tool that aims to accelerate document research by summarizing multi-format content, simplifying complex topics, and extracting desired information. It can be utilized in various scenarios such as research companion, communibot for internal communications, customer aid bot for enhancing customer service, contract navigator for understanding legal agreements, and IT intellect for managing and improving tech infrastructure.
