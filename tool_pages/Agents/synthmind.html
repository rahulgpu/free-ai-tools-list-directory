            <h2>About SynthMind</h2>
            <p>SynthMind AI is an intelligence assistant tool that provides AI Agents to make work tasks easier and more productive. This tool currently offers Meeting Minutes Assistant and Company Research Assistant, with the promise of more AI Agents becoming available in the future. The Meeting Minutes Assistant allows users to upload meeting transcripts, which are then automatically processed to generate professional meeting minutes in a short period of time. On the other hand, the Company Research Assistant enables users to enter a company name and receive an automated search and collection of information, resulting in a professional research report. SynthMind AI Agents are designed using LLM capabilities and customized thinking and working methods based on different work scenarios. This customization allows users to complete specific tasks efficiently, thereby enabling them to focus on more significant matters. The tool takes data security seriously, as user data is stored on encrypted cloud servers, with users having full control and the ability to permanently delete data. Furthermore, SynthMind.app assures that data will not be shared or disclosed to anyone.For those interested in trying out the tool, a free trial is available for each Agent, and users can subscribe to an Agent after the trial period. Subscription options include monthly and annual plans, with an annual subscription receiving a 17% discount. Users have the flexibility to cancel or renew their subscription at any time. Additionally, users have the option to customize the Agent's preset structure through Agent Designing after subscribing to better align with their specific requirements.</p>
