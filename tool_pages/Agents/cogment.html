            <h2>About Cogment</h2>
            <p>Cogment is an innovative open-source AI platform developed by AI Redefined. The platform is designed to facilitate human-AI collaboration and leverage the power of AI for the benefit of humankind. Cogment enables the building, training, and operation of AI agents in both simulated and real environments, fostering continuous training of humans and AI together.Key features of Cogment include multi-actor capability, allowing multiple agents and human users to interact with each other and their environment in collaborative or competitive setups. The platform supports various training methods, including reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and curriculum learning.Cogment is tech stack agnostic, meaning that it can work seamlessly with different frameworks such as PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow, as well as environments like Unity, OpenAI Gym, and Petting Zoo.The platform also supports multi-experience learning, running multiple instances of the same agent in distributed trials/experiences. It enables implementation swapping, allowing seamless transitions between different agent implementations, including human users, trained agents, and pseudo-humans or rule-based agents. Multiple sources of rewards, including environment, users, and other agents, can be utilized for reinforcement learning.Cogment offers a hybrid AI approach, enabling the integration of different types of agents, such as expert systems, neural networks, planners, and more. It optimizes the development and deployment process by minimizing discontinuity between the two stages, facilitating quick iteration cycles between simulated and real environments.Documentation and community support are available through the Cogment website, including an overview, core concepts, development guides, and references for CLI and SDK usage. The platform is backed by AI Redefined, a reputable AI company.</p>
