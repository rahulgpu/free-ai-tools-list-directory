            <h2>About NexusGPT</h2>
            <p>NexusGPT is a no-code AI assistant builder designed to automate workflows. It allows users to build and integrate custom AI agents that are made up of the knowledge you upload, tasks they can perform, and tools they can call. This capability enables users to construct virtually any agent for use in different fields like sales, customer support, research, marketing, and operations. NexusGPT offers features like auto planning and execution, where the agents not only execute tasks but also autonomously complete complex objectives by planning. The platform provides an ever-growing marketplace for buying and selling ready-made agents that are fine-tuned by specialists. Additionally, NexusGPT boasts a marketplace of more than 1500 tools and integrations to extend the capabilities of your agent. Users can craft an agent to understand their tasks better by providing examples. The platform also supports integration with existing apps, such as Microsoft Teams, Slack, WhatsApp, Email, and others. NexusGPT doesn't bind users to the interface of a single-provider and allows them to power their agents with large language models from various sources such as OpenAI, Mistral, Claude, or any open-source model. Users can create an agent by talking to the agent builder, uploading various types of documents, integrating tools from their marketplace, and deploying within their required platforms. The platform is designed to make agent creation, customization, and deployment as straightforward as possible. NexusGPT is also praised for its flexibility and effectiveness by various users in the AI space.</p>
