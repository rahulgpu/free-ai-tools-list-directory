            <h2>About Monoid</h2>
            <p>Monoid is a tool designed to enhance Large Language Models' (LLMs) real-time functioning by transforming APIs into Actions that build AI Agents. It directs LLMs to gather the relevant context and function on users' behalf as an AI Agent. Monoid eases the process of AI Agent creation by allowing users to select a foundational LLM, an Agent Type, and several Actions. To further optimize the process, users can decide which parameters the AI Agent regulates. Monoid also facilitates the testing of APIs as Actions by simulating an AI Agent's response to natural language using the user's API. A remarkable feature allows users to converse with their AI agent as it takes advantage of multiple Actions. Monoid encourages sharing of actions and agents on their hub to aid in the construction of a vibrant network. It comes in handy for various use-cases such as acting as a shopping assistant, a customer support agent, and a workflow automator. For instance, as a shopping assistant, an AI Agent can serve as a business concierge and recommend products in conversational style. As a customer support agent, it can empower customers to autonomously resolve issues. As a workflow automator, it eliminates the need for manual repetitive tasks across IT, engineering, or operations. Monoid ensures creating Actions from your APIs is uncomplicated and effective.</p>
