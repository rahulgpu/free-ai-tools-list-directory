            <h2>About ToDoIt</h2>
            <p>ToDoIt is an AI-powered task management tool that utilizes voice command technology to aid in productivity. At its core, the tool provides a method for quick task organization. Users can speak their daily tasks or goals into the tool, which will then use the commands to generate a task list. The purpose of this feature is to enable users to focus on productivity and execution, rather than spending time manually entering tasks. One of the notable features is its AI-powered task recommendations. This feature takes the user's inputs and provides them with task recommendations, further assisting in task organization and prioritization. Based on the privacy and security FAQs, user data is stored securely and used solely to provide app services. Notably, audio files for transcription are deleted immediately after processing. However, the app does not store voice recordings; instead, it converts voice commands into text in real-time to manage to-do lists. ToDoIt currently offers a web-based application with the tool being fully accessible and responsive on all mobile devices. The development plans include an expansion to mobile applications for both Android and iOS platforms. User feedback is encouraged and can be supplied through an external platform, Insighto. According to the information provided, ToDoIt offers a few pricing options to accommodate various needs and uses frequencies.</p>
