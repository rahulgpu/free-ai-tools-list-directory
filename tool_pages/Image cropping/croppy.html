            <h2>About Croppy</h2>
            <p>Croppy is an AI-enabled tool specifically designed for web developers and agencies. Its key function serves to streamline the process of managing and adjusting images for websites. Users can provide professional-quality images to enhance their online presence. One of Croppy's distinct features is its predefined resolutions. This enables the consistency and professional appearance of images across the website. In addition, the tool has its proprietary AI model that aids in selecting image cropping areas to ensure the most crucial parts of the image are highlighted. Croppy also supports direct uploading of refined images to Content Management Systems (CMS), and offers a unique plugin for WordPress for ease of use. Built with privacy in mind, the entire process of image manipulation is fully GDPR compliant. The tool reportedly reduces the time and cost of image processing, accelerating project flow, and reducing customer support queries. Users can also perform batch processing of images, which is particularly beneficial for online shops. The latest technologies are leveraged to reduce image size without compromising quality, such as WebP and shortly also AVIF.</p>
