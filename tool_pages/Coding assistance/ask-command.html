            <h2>About Ask Command</h2>
            <p>Ask Command is an AI-powered developer assistant tool, designed to help users recall forgotten commands. Leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3, Ask Command facilitates users by suggesting the best command for their queries. The user can use it as a quick reference tool to look up a command without needing to consult external resources, such as Google. However, it is advised to always verify and comprehend the returned commands before utilization. The tool handles queries associated with popular Unix commands and understands basic logic and conditions. The user poses a question and the tool suggests an appropriate command. Although the tool only suggests commands, it does not execute them on the user's computer. Currently available as a macOS app, it is developed with a focus on saving time by negating the need to search the commands on the internet. It is a standalone native app designed to provide a quick command referencing solution. The queries, as well as the answers, are also recorded server-side to enhance the application's capabilities. As a sanity measure, sensitive data provision in the queries is highly discouraged.</p>
