            <h2>About Hal9</h2>
            <p>Hal9 is an AI-driven app designer that provides a powerful multi-language backend to create the next generation of machine learning applications. This platform enables users to easily connect to their existing authentication and data sources, freeing them from the task of learning web development. Hal9's intuitive visual designer allows users to focus on what they enjoy doing, while providing code assets that can be further fine-tuned by web developers on their team. The platform provides first-class support and feature parity for all science and engineering runtimes, including Python, R, and JavaScript, and is currently developing support for Julia, Rust, and TypeScript. The APIs used are minimal, pragmatic, and idiomatic, with the guiding principle of not getting in the way when building.One of Hal9's notable features is the ability to build apps in the language of choice, and seamlessly combine languages and ecosystems, making it possible to do a wide range of tasks. The platform is also compliance-ready, with users having the option to run the software on their infrastructure, thus giving them complete control over data security and privacy. Hal9 has a library of apps that compute financial data, extract data and run machine learning models, all built with the platform, and users can try Hal9 with their internal data on request.</p>
