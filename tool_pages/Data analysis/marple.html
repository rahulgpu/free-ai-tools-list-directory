            <h2>About Marple</h2>
            <p>Marple AI is an AI-powered tool designed to provide insights into time series data. With Marple AI, users can ask questions about their data and automatically generate relevant plots or perform complex calculations. The tool utilizes GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) to apply user prompts to large datasets, resulting in fast response times. One of the key features of Marple AI is its ability to automatically generate plots based on user prompts. Users can write questions about the specific data they would like to see, and Marple AI will generate graphs with signals that are relevant for their question. These generated graphs can then be modified for deeper analysis.Additionally, Marple AI can perform complex calculations based on user questions. Users can ask questions such as the average fuel consumption in a specific gear, the number of times the temperature exceeded a certain threshold during nighttime, or the most common failure state in a specific month. These questions are transformed by GPT into computations that the time series data engine of Marple AI performs.Another notable feature of Marple AI is its integration with state-of-the-art visualization capabilities. If users get interesting results from Marple AI, they can directly jump into a visualization of the underlying data and utilize different graphing capabilities to investigate the data behind the AI result.Marple AI supports data from various sources such as files and InfluxDB, and offers an API or SDK for integration into users' workflow. It also promises faster visualization compared to Python and MATLAB, with computation results being 4-100x faster.</p>
