            <h2>About Athena Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Athena is the first AI-native analytics platform and artificial employee designed to optimize analytic workflows for enterprise teams. It plays two roles: as a co-pilot, it learns your workflow and as an auto-pilot, it allows for autonomous execution. Athena is a comprehensive tool for data analysis as it allows for data exploration, report compilation, and follow-up questions. Moreover, it can cope with complex industry-specific workflows, offering SQL and Python-based execution environments. Taking advantage of its powerful, self-serve platform, its aim is to help users explore, analyze, and act on their data. Athena features a natural language interface for data interaction, and its capability of learning from existing documentation, data, and analyses allows teams to focus more on creating new insights. This tool offers scalability in enterprise workflows and is built for collaborative use, so it can be used by more than a hundred users concurrently. Furthermore, Athena has a complimentary service, Athena Wrapped, designed for the end of the year, which allows users to delegate significant tasks, such as year-end reports or in-depth analyses, to the AI. Athena adapts to the unique characteristics of your data, supporting you in handling complex questions and not getting overwhelmed by mundane tasks.</p>
