With the employee map, organizations can visualize their team distribution across geographical boundaries. It also presents an organizational chart to understand hierarchical reporting structures and team connections. Furthermore, the platform allows automated data synchronization from multiple HRIS systems, ensuring up-to-date and accurate employee databases. The service offers a browser extension that enables users to access profiles seamlessly during their workflow. Integration with GoLinks provides an additional method of access, allowing users to find profiles by using specific address bar commands.</p>
