            <h2>About Ai To Cards</h2>
            <p>AI To Cards is a tool designed to aid learning by creating Anki flashcards from any provided text. It leverages the OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo model to generate these cards using a custom prompt, which are then converted into a format that is compatible with Anki or other spaced repetition software. This process allows users to effortlessly transform any piece of text into a portable and easily reviewable learning material. Users start by inputting their preferred text into the designated area and clicking 'Convert' which prompts a file download. The downloaded file can be imported into Anki for study sessions. It should be noted, however, that the tool has a maximum text length of 5000 characters. In cases where the text surpasses this length, it can be split into multiple parts for individual processing. The tool implements a credit-based payment model and offers a certain amount of free credits each month, while additional credits are available for purchase. As for data safety, AI To Cards stores only the user-provided texts and the generated cards, with no storage of personal information beyond that. However, texts are sent to OpenAI for processing, so users are advised against using sensitive information. The website includes terms of use that provide additional details.</p>
