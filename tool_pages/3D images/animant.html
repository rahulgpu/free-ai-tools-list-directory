            <h2>About Animant</h2>
            <p>Animant is an AI-powered storytelling tool that allows users to create engaging experiences by blending their imagination with the world around them. This tool enables users to write scenes with natural language, turning their words into interactive 3D stories without requiring any knowledge of 3D animation. Animant can generate simple 3D objects with accurate appearances and measurements, making it accessible for anyone to build engaging product demos or classroom sessions with practical experiments in augmented reality (AR).Designed with AR at its core, Animant allows users to visualize interactive 3D experiences within their real-world environments and merge the real world with the virtual one. Users can create 3D models using their camera, scanning physical objects and even entire rooms to construct 3D floor plans. Animant also offers the ability to blend dimensions by incorporating 2D photos, PDF documents, and videos alongside 3D content. It introduces an intuitive feature that enables users to drop waypoints along a walking route in AR, directing the movement of objects and enhancing scene-building efficiency.The tool includes a comprehensive studio and supports features such as object capture, lights, physics, offline rendering, and Markdown-based captions. Animant prioritizes privacy by not collecting any personally identifiable information. It is available for iOS 16+, iPadOS 16+, and macOS Ventura 13+, with plans to expand to Apple Vision Pro.</p>
