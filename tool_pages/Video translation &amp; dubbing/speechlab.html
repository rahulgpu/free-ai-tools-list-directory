            <h2>About Speechlab</h2>
            <p>Speechlab is an AI-powered tool designed to automate dubbing for audio and video files. The platform makes it possible to upload a file and instantly receive an editable transcript, translation, and dub in matching voices. The service additionally facilitates acquiring captions, subtitles, and dubbed audio or video. This end-to-end platform features AI-generated transcription with speaker labels and detailed timing. The translation output is also AI-produced from the proofed transcript and available in text, subtitles, or JSON format. To amplify realism, the dubbing function of Speechlab can match either the original speaker's voice or that of a native speaker. The service prides itself in providing dubbed output that sounds natural and is indistinguishable from human speech. Speechlab supports numerous language pairs and dialects and extends professional support for seamless tool usage. The platform is constructed to easily scale with enterprise systems and processes. It allows content sharing and collaboration among team members, in addition to offering a white glove service which utilises a network of vetted specialists to review translations and dubs. Import and export for content management and localisation services is also possible with Speechlab. The service finds applicability in varied sectors including media, for podcasts, documentaries, news, and scripted content; enterprise, for pre-sales, marketing, customer onboarding, and compliance videos; and the education sector, to expand access to instructional videos.</p>
