            <h2>About Genji</h2>
            <p>Genji is an AI tool designed to assist users in automating browser tasks. The tool operates as your browser sidekick, completing tasks inputted in plain language. This involves a sequence of browser actions, which the AI deduces in a continuous manner until the task is complete. Genji is capable of handling multiple tasks concurrently. The AI tool has several capabilities including: reading the current state of your browser screen, using AI to determine the appropriate actions to finish your task, and self-correcting errors. Future updates intend to add voice input commands and output messages, task scheduling, and the ability to record and replay video macros. Tasks can be personal or professional, from buying products online to creating playlists or completing work-related assignments. Despite his capabilities, Genji is a work in progress, continually evolving with new features. He might struggle with more complex tasks or uncommon web patterns and requires supervised use followed by constructive feedback. The users' security and privacy are a high priority, with no storage of screenshots from your browser and all communications performed over a secure, encrypted connection. While Genji is an efficient tool for automating tasks, his main vision is to aid users in being more productive on their browsers.</p>
