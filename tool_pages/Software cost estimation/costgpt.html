            <h2>About CostGPT</h2>
            <p>CostGPT is an AI-based Software Development Cost Estimator built by Codebuddy. It is designed to help users estimate the cost and time required for various software development projects. Upon providing a detailed description of the software idea or a reference URL, the AI-powered platform would generate a comprehensive cost and time estimate including a suggested tech stack and list of features necessary for the software. In each estimate, users receive a breakdown of the costs, timeline, deliverables, and a recommended tech stack best suited for building their software. It also provides a list of functionalities along with their dependencies that the software will be able to perform. Although CostGPT is built on the data derived from numerous projects and strives to provide accurate estimates, users are advised to interpret the results with caution due to the inherent uncertainties in predictions. It is user-friendly and can be utilized by anyone wishing to get an estimate for their software development projects. However, the platform is not designed to handle sensitive or confidential information, so users are advised not to share such details in the input prompt.</p>
