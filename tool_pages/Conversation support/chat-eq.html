            <h2>About Chat EQ</h2>
            <p>Chat EQ is an AI tool geared towards helping users develop better conflict resolution skills through interactive dialogues. By analyzing provided input about a difficult situation, the tool gives research-based feedback and guidance to enable more effective communication. Its primary application lies in providing coaching for conflict resolution in both personal and professional situations, although it is not intended to serve as a replacement for professional medical advice or treatment. Users are expected to use the tool responsibly and agree not to share the tools content without explicit permission from the creators. Chat EQ stores user's conversation and coaching data for continuous app improvement and may further provide aggregated stories to researchers to help in studying trends related to conflicts and difficult conversations. From workplaces dealing with remote work challenges to homes witnessing increased conflicts during pandemic conditions, Chat EQ could play a pivotal role in equipping people with essential conflict management skills. However, it's important to note that it doesn't claim to replace professionals such as psychologists, social workers etc, but rather aims to provide basic tools to handle conflicts more effectively.</p>
