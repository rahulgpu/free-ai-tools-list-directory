            <h2>About Ello</h2>
            <p>Ello is an app-based reading coach that aims to transform children into confident and enthusiastic readers. The tool is designed to listen to your child as they read from physical books, providing teaching and motivation. Incorporating a patent-pending speech recognition and adaptive learning technology, Ello engages with the child as they develop their reading skills. The aim is to elevate the reading experience rather than distract from it. Ello also offers a subscription service where expertly chosen books matching your child's reading level and interests are delivered monthly. The child reads these books out loud to Ello, which then provides coaching. The app uses specific strategies to encourage the development of reading fluency and to ensure the child does not get frustrated. Ello further incentivizes reading by allowing children to earn rewards as they read, fostering a more enthusiastic attitude towards the reading habit. The tool also empowers the user to decide whether to return or keep the books. Ello targets to offer an effective solution to parents and teachers looking to improve their child's reading skills and instil a love for reading.</p>
