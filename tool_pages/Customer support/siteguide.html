            <h2>About SiteGuide</h2>
            <p>SiteGuide is an AI assistant tool designed to optimize the interaction between visitors and websites. Offering 24/7 support, it assists visitors in navigating websites, answering queries in real-time, and guiding users to the part of the site with the information they need. It works by instantly learning about the specific website's content and helps users locate what they are looking for. SiteGuide also addresses the issue of potential customers leaving the sites due to difficulty in finding needed information and aims to lower this occurrence. Furthermore, it aids website owners by providing insights into what their visitors are searching for, assisting them in adding relevant content that could lead to increased conversions. SiteGuide is also aimed at increasing website accessibility, catering to audiences like older adults, those who are not technically confident, people with low-vision, or those with reading difficulties like dyslexia. Rather than purely responding to user queries, this tool uses advanced AI techniques to proactively navigate and open the correct part of the website. It also features a feedback system where users can see questions and answers in real-time, and respond via SMS, with SiteGuide learning from these responses. It integrates easily with platforms like Wix, requiring just one line of code for integration.</p>
