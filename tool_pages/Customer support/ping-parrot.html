            <h2>About Ping Parrot</h2>
            <p>Ping Parrot is an AI-powered chatbot which aids in automating customer support services on a user's website. The chatbot is capable of addressing numerous customer inquiries, reducing the need for human intervention to a significant extent. With a straightforward setup process that does not require coding, users can integrate the chatbot seamlessly into their website. The chatbot training is based on the users knowledge-base, which it uses to provide credible responses to the customers. It is designed to be available perpetually, thus ensuring a constant line of communication with customers regardless of the time of day. Ping Parrot also presents a language versatility, supporting conversation in more than 80 different languages. This functionality increases its usefulness in responding to international customers. Furthermore, the tool incorporates a feature enabling human support to join the conversation if required. This function allows for an escalation of help for customers if the chatbot is unable to sufficiently address their queries. The chatbots appearance can also be customized to match the user's brand aesthetics. Ping Parrot allows users to train the chatbot using their website content and FAQ sections. Any changes made to the website content after chatbot training can be manually updated in the knowledge-base. Additionally, the tool offers a free plan, available with a set limit for bot training and conversations per month, with optional upgrades for premium features. With possibilities to train the chatbot in any language, Ping Parrot ensures convenience and versatility in answering customer inquiries.</p>
