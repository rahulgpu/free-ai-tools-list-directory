            <h2>About Growparabolic</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT for Customer Support, known as Parabolic, is an AI tool designed to enhance customer support services. This AI assistant is aimed at improving the efficiency and accuracy of ticket resolutions, eliminating repetitive queries, and providing specialized responses. Integrated within existing ticketing softwares like Intercom, Zendesk, or Helpscout, it uses a 'human-in-the-loop' model where responses are verified by agents before they're sent, allowing it to learn and improve over time. With just one match in past conversations or knowledge base, Parabolic can suggest responses, even addressing rarely asked queries. It's capable of navigating multiple back-and-forths as conversations progress. Another distinct feature is its ability to append relevant upsells or cross-sells based on the customer's issue, turning customer support into a potential sales channel. The 'Auto-Categorize' feature is designed to automatically tag and direct incoming questions to the appropriate category like payments, memberships, etc. It's also designed to detect a user's intent, independent of specific keywords, and draft two types of responses: generalizable and customer-specific. Generalizable responses can be used for common queries, while customer-specific responses utilize information from your internal database for more personalized assistance.</p>
