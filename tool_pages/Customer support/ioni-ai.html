            <h2>About Ioni AI</h2>
            <p>ioni.ai is an AI tool that provides a ChatGPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) solution for customer support teams. It offers an automated system to help customer support teams resolve tickets faster while reducing costs, and providing more efficient responses to inquiries. It improves productivity by using auto-responding to increase the number of solved tickets while simultaneously reducing the time customers wait for a response. This system integrates with many popular CXM (Customer Experience Management) systems with just one click. This tool also includes a suggested auto-reply feature, which automates routine inquiries with just one click. Using natural language processing, it generates suggested replies that are grammatically correct and aligned with the brand voice. Additionally, Guide AI instructs the AI system to understand the problem, describe tone and style of response to provide extended answers. With the latest technology, using ChatGPT-4, customers can communicate in a human-like manner with the AI solution. The tool offers self-learning capabilities, i.e. if an agent independently responds to a request, an answer is automatically added to the Knowledge Base. ioni.ai also offers an early access program for users to become early adopters and get access to the latest features and benefits, such as immediate responses, resolving and close up to 80% of common tickets with just one click and increase in response speed even on complex inquiries up to 3x times.</p>
