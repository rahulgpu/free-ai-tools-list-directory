            <h2>About Gladly Sidekick</h2>
            <p>Gladly's new AI and automation platform, Sidekick, revolutionizes customer service by enabling personalized self-service. Sidekick works together with Gladly Hero, their people-centered platform for agent-assisted customer service. The platform was developed after acquiring Thankful, an AI and automation solution for customer self-service. This acquisition has allowed Gladly to bring AI and automation to the forefront of customer service.Unlike AI solutions lacking a deep customer focus, Sidekick aims to engage and care for customers rather than deflecting them. It recognizes that AI needs to be applied with an understanding of a brand's unique needs, voice, and content to avoid frustrating customers. Gladly believes that to build customer loyalty, customer service must be both people-centered and AI-powered.Sidekick utilizes generative AI and no-code automation to provide scaled and personalized customer self-service through Self Service Threads. It goes beyond answering common customer service questions and can execute transactions like managing returns or processing exchanges. Sidekick aims to resolve customer issues rather than just responding to them, ensuring a smooth and positive experience.Real-life examples of Sidekick's application include Crate & Barrel streamlining routine requests like returns or exchanges and matching customers to specific service agents based on live context. Bombas reduces the workload on their Customer Happiness Team by enabling customers to self-service basic tasks and questions.Gladly's mission is to empower businesses to deliver radically personal experiences, putting the customer at the center of everything they do. With investments in generative AI and the acquisition of Thankful, Sidekick embodies their commitment to this mission.</p>
