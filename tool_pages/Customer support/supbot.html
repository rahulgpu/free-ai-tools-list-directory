            <h2>About SupBot</h2>
            <p>SupBot is an AI-driven support solution designed to handle customer support instantly. It allows users to train and deploy AI-powered support bots for their respective business or projects. The setup process for the bot is straightforward - users can train the bot to function based on certain inputs, test the bot for accuracy, and then deploy it with minimal coding required. The deployment process involves merely copying and pasting a script into the user's project or website. SupBot has an in-built ticketing system which it utilizes to organize and manage customer inquiries. SupBot incorporates OpenAI technology to generate customized support bots, taking advantage of the flexibility and adaptability of this AI engine. Once integrated into a website, the bot handles chat support, leaving the human resource to focus on other important tasks. If a customer requests to speak to a human, a notification is forwarded via email, providing an efficient way of ensuring customer satisfaction.The tool offers two pricing plans: 'Standard' and 'Premium'. In the Standard plan, users can train and deploy one bot whereas with the Premium plan, users can train and deploy up to five bots. Both plans allow for unlimited bot retraining and vary in the number of monthly messages catered. For technical support needs, users can simply indicate such a need through the chatbot.Continually striving to provide an easy and seamless experience for users looking to integrate AI within their customer support process, SupBot presents itself as an efficient AI support solution.</p>
