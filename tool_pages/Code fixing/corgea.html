            <h2>About Corgea</h2>
            <p>Corgea is an artificial intelligence-based tool designed to aid security teams in issuing fixes for vulnerable code. The platform uses AI to generate patches or changes that engineers can review, thereby enabling the implementation of swift, appropriate fixes to system vulnerabilities. This allows engineers to direct more focus towards revenue-generating tasks, thus increasing overall operational efficiency.Corgea is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing security practices. For example, the tool connects with existing Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools from its connector catalog to produce code fixes. Once these fixes are generated, they can be issued to your engineers with just a single click, driving down your vulnerability burn rate without overburdening your engineering team.The tool is developer-friendly, meaning it does not require engineers to log into another system or learn new commands. It takes care of distributing code fixes through popular code hosting platforms like Github, Gitlab, or Bitbucket. This enhances the flexibility and responsiveness of the security team while ensuring that coding vulnerabilities are addressed quickly and effectively.As a versatile tool, Corgea works with any coding language, facilitating a wide range of code bases. Overall, the platform is dedicated to automating the process of code security, allowing teams to build secure products with greater peace of mind.</p>
