            <h2>About Dropbox Dash</h2>
            <p>Dropbox Dash is an AI-powered universal search tool designed for efficient workflow management. This tool allows users to search across all their tabs, apps, and even more specific content areas such as emails. It doesn't only help with content within Dropbox but also goes beyond by interacting with various other tools such as Google Workspace, Microsoft Outlook, Salesforce, and Notion among others, offering a cohesive search experience. It's equipped to search the entire desktop including open browser tabs, calendar, emails and more in seconds. Besides its search functionality, Dropbox Dash further aids in organizing the workspace by providing features like 'Stacks' that enables superior organization beyond folders and bookmarks, allowing grouping of important information from files, apps, and browser links together which can be shared and updated within a team. It provides a unique feature of displaying the entire workday in one central page, assisting users to stay on top of their important meetings, files, and prioritized projects. The tool also includes a feature where users can ask questions and get summarized relevant information gathered from apps, files, and content. Currently, Dropbox Dash is in its beta phase and available in English only.</p>
