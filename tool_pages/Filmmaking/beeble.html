            <h2>About Beeble</h2>
            <p>SwitchLight Studio by Beeble is a tool designed to redefine VFX and compositing for filmmakers. It integrates artificial intelligence and physically-based rendering to enable users to alter lighting post-production. The AI system in SwitchLight Studio generates individual passes for a video, such as depth, normal, roughness, albedo, specular, and ambient occlusion, describing how light interacts with the surface of objects. This includes capturing the true color of objects without shadows or lighting effects via the albedo pass and 3D geometry through the normal and depth map. The solution uses Physically-based rendering to replicate real-world lighting accurately. Moreover, SwitchLight Studio features AI Virtual Production, which facilitates the seamless integration of actors into varying environments with realistic lighting. Users can use its distinct functions: background removal, PBR material and depth extraction, physically based rendering, PBR neural enhancer, and light map extraction. With these features, users can transform their PBR results, improve realism, create digital doubles, and more, without requiring a comprehensive understanding of AI or 3D software. For professionals, the software promotes unlimited creativity through individual PBR passes, 4K+ resolution support, guaranteed temporal consistency across frames, and PBR loader for Blender and Unreal Engine. The solution also provides local processing for image or video data, respecting user's privacy. Kids the software offers enterprise features like Nuke plugin for post-production streamlining, command-line interface, offline capability, and multi-OS support. Besides, Beeble offers SwitchLight Studio's AI suite as an API, a web-based version, and a mobile application for added flexibility.</p>
