            <h2>About TrustLoop</h2>
            <p>TrustLoop is an online reputation management software that primarily focuses on maximizing positive customer feedback and managing negative reviews. The tool is targeted towards online product owners and uses proprietary technology to manage public and private reviews effectively. It facilitates the collection of positive reviews which are displayed publicly, while channeling constructive criticisms or negative feedback privately to the owners. TrustLoop incorporates AI technology to provide actionable insights from the reviews and feedback. It further offers the ability to add a customizable widget or popup to the user's website for capturing reviews more efficiently. The software enables routing of satisfied users to third-party review platforms to leave additional positive reviews. TrustLoop is also designed to be intuitive, and it's built with a fully customizable survey builder to achieve the most effective results. It offers a custom landing page where feedback and reviews can be gathered and sorted out. Automations within the tool help to speed up processes, allowing users to focus more on addressing the customer needs or product improvements rather than manual management of reviews. Furthermore, TrustLoop presents options for choosing the most appropriate point in the user journey to ask for reviews or feedback. This feature helps in capturing feedback at the right time thereby leading to more accuracy and relevance. The software operates on a subscription basis, offering different plans tailored to suit various needs and size of the user base.</p>
