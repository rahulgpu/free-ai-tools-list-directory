            <h2>About AlterAI</h2>
            <p>Alter AI is an AI-powered image generation platform that utilizes machine learning models to transform amateur selfies into professional headshots. It offers a convenient and affordable solution for individuals seeking high-quality headshots to enhance their professional profiles, job applications, websites, or social media presence.With Alter AI, users can easily upload their selfies and choose from different styles and options to create stunning headshots. The AI technology embedded in the platform enhances the uploaded photos while preserving a natural and authentic appearance, ensuring that the final result looks like a professionally captured photograph rather than a product of AI manipulation.The platform provides a range of pricing plans to suit different needs, with options for a varying number of real headshots, different turnaround times, and a selection of styles. The process typically takes between 30 to 90 minutes, depending on the chosen plan, and users can expect to receive a set of over 40 to 120 high-resolution headshots, meeting or exceeding the requirements of popular platforms such as LinkedIn and Instagram.While a free trial is not available due to the GPU-intensive nature of generating headshots, Alter AI offers refunds within 7 days if users are not satisfied with their results, provided they have followed the photo guidelines. Users also have complete freedom to use the generated headshots for any purpose, as they are granted a full commercial license and ownership.The platform ensures data security by storing user data on trusted, secure third-party servers managed by companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. After training its AI model and creating the headshots, Alter AI deletes the user's data from its servers within 30 days, thus maintaining privacy and data protection.</p>
