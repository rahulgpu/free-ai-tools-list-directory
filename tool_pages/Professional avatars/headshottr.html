            <h2>About Headshottr</h2>
            <p>Headshottr is an AI-powered tool designed to generate professional headshots. The tool is primarily intended for usage on platforms such as LinkedIn, business websites, and social media. The users can upload multiple high-quality pictures, and the platform takes care of generating their professional headshots using state of the art machine learning. This aims to eliminate the need for a professional photo studio, hence saving time, money, and resources. The AI model is trained on the likeness of the users, ensuring the generated headshots accurately represent them. Customers can expect to receive their photos in about an hour. The service also offers options for individual or group purchases. Headshottr provides an interactive photo picker, allowing users to select which generated photos they wish to download. These photos can be downloaded at a resolution of 1024x1536 and are free for both commercial and private use. Headshottr offers their services at competitive pricing and ensures customer satisfaction by issuing a full refund if the client is not satisfied or a single coupon code to redo a headshot that was submitted.</p>
