In addition to creating generic chatbots, Chat Data offers specialized models for creating medical chatbots.

Chat Data provides users with the ability to share their chatbot creations with others. It also emphasizes data privacy, ensuring that conversation histories are not stored on its servers but retained within the user's browser. The platform allows users to personalize their chatbot training process and integrate the chatbot widget directly with a custom model endpoint. The interface can be tailored to align with the user's brand personality and can train the chatbot using different types of data formats. Advanced features such as integrating FAQ links, customizing the appearance of the chatbot, integrating third-party tools, and implementing rate limiting for public chatbots are also available. Analytical tools are incorporated into the platform, enabling users to gain insights from chatbot conversations, understand the user base's geography, and gather leads for future interactions.
