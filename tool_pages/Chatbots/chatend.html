            <h2>About Chatend</h2>
            <p>Chatend is a platform that allows users to develop, deploy, and interact with their own chatbot applications using AI technology. It provides a self-service portal called Chatend IDE for building and managing bots on the platform. With powerful features like Custom Commands, users can teach their bots to interact with both digital and physical worlds. They can also utilize features such as Keystore to read and write persistent data, Environment Variables to share API keys and other values between commands, and System Prompt to guide their bot through interactions.For individuals, Chatend enables tasks like summarizing email inboxes, controlling home lights, creating reminders and events, locating cars, extracting important information from industry news, and tracking sports scores and news. In group chats, it can summarize lengthy chat transcripts, answer questions about the chat and its members, memorize rules and detect violations, play text-based games, monitor financial news and stock prices, and acknowledge active members.For enterprise users, Chatend offers functionalities like sending personalized emails and PDFs to customers, answering employee and customer queries using company documents, searching databases, monitoring invoices and bills, querying Salesforce and updating records, and integrating with any API.Chatend has been applied successfully in various case studies, including Emma, the first bot produced using the technology, West Ham GC, which generated memes, ranked users, and provided humorous financial answers, Ask Andi for Munichain, which allowed users to query the company's internal bonds database using natural language, and @I95Progress, a Twitter bot that live-tweeted the I-95 bridge reconstruction efforts.The platform also boasts easy configuration, cost transparency, code customization, a single service interface, and a dedicated account manager. It supports deployment on multiple channels, including email, SMS, phone, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, FB Messenger, Twitch, Minecraft, Roblox, and the web.</p>
