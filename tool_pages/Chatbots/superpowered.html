            <h2>About Superpowered</h2>
            <p>Superpowered AI is a developer API that provides a knowledge retrieval solution specifically designed for LLM (Language Model) applications. This tool allows for the retrieval of relevant information, which can be easily inserted into LLM prompts to deliver highly relevant responses to users. Superpowered AI offers a complete end-to-end solution, eliminating the need to piece together a system from multiple providers, so developers can stay focused on creating value for their customers rather than building infrastructure. The tool is easy to use, allowing for the creation of a knowledge base directly from local files, folders, or a URL in less than 10 lines of code. Superpowered AI also offers state-of-the-art multi-stage knowledge retrieval pipeline, which provides the most relevant results to improve performance. Optional LLM-generated summaries of retrieved knowledge, with citations, are also available. Additionally, Superpowered AI offers a low price point, which is significantly less than alternatives like OpenAI embeddings + Pinecone. The tool offers several use cases such as customizing your LLM application with your own data, giving your LLMs access to private information that wasn’t included in its training data, creating long-term memory for your chatbots, and reducing hallucinations that may result in irrelevant responses. Superpowered AI is accessible through REST API calls, and documentation and examples are provided to assist developers in getting started. The tool offers knowledge-as-a-service backed by a dedicated Support Team that provides assistance in building applications.</p>
