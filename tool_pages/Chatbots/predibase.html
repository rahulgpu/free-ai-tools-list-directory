            <h2>About Predibase</h2>
            <p>Predibase is a low-code AI platform designed specifically for developers. It aims to provide a fast and efficient way to train, finetune, and deploy machine learning (ML) models, ranging from simple linear regressions to large language models. With Predibase, developers can achieve these tasks by writing just a few lines of configuration code, eliminating the need for extensive coding.The platform offers various solutions for different use cases, such as large language models, audio classification, bot detection, credit card fraud detection, customer sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and topic classification.Predibase is built by AI leaders from companies like Uber, Google, Apple, and Amazon, lending credibility to its development and deployment process. It is capable of handling private hosting and customization of large language models, allowing developers to build their own Generalized Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) models.The platform simplifies model building and deployment by automating complex coding tasks, providing a declarative approach that accelerates AI projects. Predibase also offers comprehensive model management and customization capabilities, enabling users to make granular-level adjustments to their models.Deployment of ML models is made easy with Predibase's scalable infrastructure. It is built on the Horovod and Ray frameworks, providing flexible options for batch and real-time inference. Users can choose to deploy models within their own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), on the Predibase cloud, or export models for external use.Overall, Predibase aims to cater to developers of all skill levels, offering simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency in building and deploying custom ML models. By eliminating the reliance on external APIs, developers can have full ownership and control over their models and ensure data privacy. The platform is built on proven open-source technologies like Ludwig and Horovod, providing a solid foundation for ML development and productionization.</p>
