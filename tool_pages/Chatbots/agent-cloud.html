            <h2>About Agent Cloud</h2>
            <p>Agent Cloud is an open-source platform designed to enable companies to build, deploy, and engage with private LLM (Large Language Model) chat applications. These applications allow teams to engage in secure conversations with their data, enhancing data accessibility and insights. The platform is compatible with both open-source and Cloud-hosted LLM, which makes it model agnostic. This means users can connect their own open-source model or leverage tools like Open AI. To ensure enhanced privacy, users can connect Agent Cloud to their locally hosted models. With built-in support for data from over 300 sources, the platform minimizes integration hassles enabling the easy chunking, splitting, and embedding of data. Conversations with data are made possible by syncing, storing, and then constructing chat sessions using your choice of LLM. The platform's data pipeline is automated and can be set to manual, scheduled, or a cron expression, ensuring fresh and updated source data. In terms of infrastructure, Agent Cloud has a modular open-source architecture designed to scale seamlessly with your organization. This includes a built-in ELT pipeline powered by Airbyte, a message bus powered by RabbitMQ, and a Vector Database powered by Qdrant. Users thereby have access to a scalable, secure, and versatile platform for creating sophisticated AI applications while ensuring that their private data remains private.</p>
