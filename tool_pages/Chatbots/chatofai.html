            <h2>About ChatofAI</h2>
            <p>chatof.ai is a tool that allows you to easily create customized AI chatbots using your own data and the ChatGPT model. With this tool, you can import different types of documents such as .doc, .docx, .pdf, .txt, and .md files, as well as website URLs and sitemaps, to feed to your chatbot. The chatbot is trained on this data and can provide answers to questions based on the information it has been given. If the answer is not contained in the provided data, the chatbot will respond with "I don't know".One of the key features of chatof.ai is its flexibility in deployment. You can choose to make your chatbot public, allowing users to access and interact with it without the need for sign-ups. Alternatively, you can keep it private and only accessible by you. The chatbot can be easily shared or embedded as an iframe or widget on various platforms, including websites.The tool supports multiple languages and provides help through an email support service. The data used to train the chatbot is not specifically mentioned as being used to train ChatGPT itself. Additionally, chatof.ai offers terms of service, a privacy policy, and various channels to contact their support team.</p>
