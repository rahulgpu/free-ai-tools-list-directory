            <p>Insights is an AI-powered tool designed to enhance productivity and accuracy in legal document analysis. The tool automates the document processing pipeline, enabling the extraction and understanding of content within legal documents, which traditionally requires substantial manual analysis. Built with a primary focus on expediting and automating tasks in legal work such as eDiscovery, contract review, and case law research, Insights aims to reduce both time and costs associated with these processes. Using machine learning, it can be trained to work in a manner similar to manual review and analysis, thus reducing errors.

By harnessing AI capabilities, the tool can quickly identify information or documents required to build a case. Moreover, its natural language processing allows for effective interaction with your legal documents, asking questions and getting accurate answers based on the content. It also has specific functionalities for contract analysis, extracting and analyzing business information contained in large volumes of contracts, identifying risks, anomalies, future financial obligations, renewal and expiration dates. Lastly, its legal research capabilities utilize AI to quickly find relevant cases and precedence, making the task of sorting through volumes of case law much more efficient. Used by both individuals and firms, Insights aims to increase accuracy and productivity while reducing case or project costs, potentially increasing the profitability of a firm.</p>
