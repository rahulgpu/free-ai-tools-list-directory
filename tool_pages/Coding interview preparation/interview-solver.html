            <h2>About Interview Solver</h2>
            <p>Interview Solver is an AI-powered tool designed as an aiding instrument for solving live coding and system design interviews. Its main functionality revolves around providing solutions to coding problems taken from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CoderPad. It operates as a desktop app, where the user can highlight any text on any platform and the AI copilot will provide a response to the query. In addition, this tool offers features like global hotkeys for ease of interaction with the AI and a screengrab tool for capturing contents of any window for solutions. The tool is engineered with syntax highlighting support for major coding languages and support for diagrams and flowcharts. Its distinctiveness stems from its training data as it includes the entire set of all LeetCode questions. The solutions provided by this tool are undetectable by browser APIs allowing users to employ this tool while participating in live interviews, reducing suspicion of cheating. Interview Solver is recommendable for coding interview candidates with some experience, saving time from having to solve LeetCode problems independently, and offers an advantage during live interviews.</p>
