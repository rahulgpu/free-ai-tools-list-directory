            <h2>About PlatePose</h2>
            <p>PlatePose is an AI-powered tool that generates professional food photos for delivery listings, marketing, and social media profiles. The tool provides users with 50+ AI food pictures in 5 different styles, and the user retains ownership of all generated images. To use the tool, users need to upload 10-20 pictures of their dishes from different angles, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. The AI model generated by PlatePose then analyses these images and generates 50+ unique food pictures. The results can be downloaded once they are ready, which typically takes 48 hours. PlatePose offers three pricing packages. The cheapest option is a one-credit package which generates AI food pictures for one dish. The most value-for-money option is the 5-credits package which generates pictures for five dishes. PlatePose also offers an enterprise package for brands and ghost kitchens. The tool is a one-time payment product without any subscription fees. The tool has received positive feedback from its users, and the WeCook network of independent freelance chefs notes that PlatePose streamlines the production of quality, on-brand, and diverse image content for independents. However, as the images are generated by AI, some may not look like the original dishes, so the tool provides multiple options from each style. PlatePose advises users to not use the tool to deceive customers about what they are buying.</p>
