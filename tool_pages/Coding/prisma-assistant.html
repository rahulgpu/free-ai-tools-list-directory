            <h2>About Prisma Assistant</h2>
            <p>Prisma Assistant is an innovative tool designed to enhance the development environment by enabling conversational interactions with your database schema. This tool integrates seamlessly within a developer's existing workflow, allowing them to gain insights and automatically generate code through natural language queries. By simply conversing with the Prisma Assistant, developers can more intuitively understand and manipulate their database schemas without the need to manually write complex queries or sift through documentation. To get started with Prisma Assistant, developers need to install the tool via npm and set an environment variable with an OpenAI API key. This setup allows the tool to leverage the capabilities of AI models, making the interaction more intelligent and context-aware. Once the server is running, users can access the Prisma Assistant through a provided URL in a web browser, enabling a smooth transition between coding and querying the database schema. Prisma Assistant currently supports customization through optional environment variables, allowing users to select different AI models or configure a custom API base URL for enhanced flexibility. The tool is in early alpha, indicating ongoing development and the potential for new features and improvements. Security is a significant consideration for Prisma Assistant, as it operates locally on the user's machine and does not transmit sensitive data externally. Users are advised to manage their OpenAI API keys carefully to maintain security. Overall, Prisma Assistant represents a forward-thinking approach to database management, promising to streamline the development process by making database interactions more intuitive and efficient.</p>
