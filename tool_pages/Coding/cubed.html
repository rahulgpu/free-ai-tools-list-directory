            <h2>About Cubed</h2>
            <p>Cubed is an AI tool designed to assist software engineers in creating tasks for their projects. By linking your project with your codebase on Github, Cubed utilizes AI technology to generate actionable and descriptive cards. These cards aim to provide developers with consistent, readable, and detailed information, helping them focus on coding without the burden of creating and organizing tasks manually. Once you set up the synchronization between Cubed and your codebase, the tool leverages the context from your codebase to continuously improve the quality of new tickets you create. This improves efficiency by providing developers with valuable guidance, accelerating their workflow, and allowing them to dedicate more time to the essential aspects of their projects.In addition to Cubed, the tool offers a VS Code plugin named Hypercubed. This plugin utilizes the generated cards and integrates them directly into the context of a Language Model Model (LLM). By doing so, Hypercubed ensures that the LLM is employed optimally, enhancing the coding experience for developers.While specific details and capabilities are not provided, Cubed emphasizes its ability to enhance task management for software engineers, using AI-generated cards to streamline processes and improve overall productivity.</p>
