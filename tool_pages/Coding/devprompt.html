            <h2>About DevPrompt</h2>
            <p>DevPromptAi is an AI-powered app designed to enhance the productivity of software developers. The tool allows developers to create, reuse, and share prompts for common software engineering tasks. With its intelligent suggestions and recommendations, DevPromptAi assists developers in generating and updating their code seamlessly. It also offers AI-powered debugging assistance, enabling efficient bug identification and fixing. Furthermore, the tool provides clear explanations and documentation for complex code snippets and algorithms, helping users understand and document their code effectively. DevPromptAi goes beyond code-related tasks and enables users to craft precise and compelling technical documentation, meeting notes, and blog posts.The app is free to use; however, a working OpenAI API key is required to access its features. Users need to obtain the OpenAI API key directly from OpenAI's platform. It is important to note that the API key is securely handled and encrypted locally on the user's device, as per DevPromptAi's privacy measures. OpenAI allows this use case of storing the API key locally. The tool does not require a ChatGPT Plus subscription; having an OpenAI API key is sufficient.Regarding costs, the token cost for chat messages and the enhanced features used are included in the overall cost associated with using the app. The cost is calculated based on the pricing structure provided by OpenAI's API and can be reviewed on the user's OpenAI dashboard for accuracy.Overall, DevPromptAi simplifies coding tasks, improves code quality through debugging assistance, and aids in code understanding and documentation.</p>
