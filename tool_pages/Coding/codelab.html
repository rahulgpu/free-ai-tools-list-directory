            <h2>About Codelab</h2>
            <p>Codelab is a versatile tool for developers that accommodates coding in various languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON. Devoid of any constraint on use-case, its multifunctional capacity makes it suitable for a plethora of web development projects, regardless of their complexity. Codelab facilitates learning, experimenting, and deploying code in a user-friendly environment. Its framework eases the concept of iterative coding, aiding developers to steadily navigate, analyze and restructure their code. Codelab also extends its functionalities to enable a seamless collaboration between team members. Apart from coding, it provides a platform to save and share your projects, thus enhancing usability and accessibility. Additionally, Codelab boasts support features that guide developers through problems and potential road-blocks they may encounter during their coding journey. Integral to Codelab's features is the AI Prompt, a tool designed to assist with generating code, thereby expediting the development process and reducing manual coding efforts. However, the specific functionalities of AI Prompt in Codelab are not provided in the given context. In summary, Codelab exists to empower developers to write, test, debug and collaborate on their code conveniently and efficiently.</p>
