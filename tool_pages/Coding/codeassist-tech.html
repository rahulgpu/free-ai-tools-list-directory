            <h2>About CodeAssist Tech</h2>
            <p>CodeAssist is an AI-driven assistant designed for enhancing programming efficiency. The tool is hinged largely on a natural language interface allowing users to interact with it as they would with a human. It offers functionality within JetBrains IDEs and Visual Studio Code, with capabilities that include directly reading from and writing into your code editor, generating and completing code while taking into consideration the context from other files, and conducting various other actions like opening files amid assisting tasks. CodeAssist's operation involves the developer's supervision and corrective measures for errors it commits, which can extent to executing complex tasks like implementing an entire feature into your application. A special feature to note is CodeAssist's non-persistent long-term memory, which erases memory upon closing and reopening the IDE, maintaining user privacy. As CodeAssist can work with popular programming languages, it grants programmers much desired versatility. With its services being charged on a credits basis, users are required to sign up, receiving an API Key for plugin settings. Once set-up, users can begin reaping the benefits of this AI-enhanced coding experience. However, it's important to note that it's an early iteration and that occasional bugs or annoyances should be expected.</p>
