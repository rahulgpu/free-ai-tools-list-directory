            <h2>About Replit</h2>
            <p>Replit AI is an AI tool developed by Replit, designed to empower software creators by redefining the software development lifecycle. With Replit AI, developers can benefit from code completion and assistance features that are now enabled by default. These features are available to both free and Pro users, with Pro users having exclusive access to the most powerful AI models and advanced functionalities.To ensure optimal performance, Replit invested significant expertise in scaling distributed systems and trained low-latency Language Models (LLMs) to handle compute-intensive AI workloads. They have successfully trained and served replit-code-v1-3b, an advanced 3B LLM with a code-heavy pretraining mixture, trained on a dataset of 1T tokens that includes 30 programming languages and a developer-oriented subset of StackExchange.Replit's roadmap for the future includes integrating AI into every single feature, acknowledging its fundamental role in software editing and deployment. As part of this evolution, Replit will eventually become synonymous with AI for software creators, aligning with their mission to empower the next billion software creators.Please note that the specific URLs provided in the text are not applicable or relevant to the functionality and purpose of Replit AI and should be excluded from the description.</p>
