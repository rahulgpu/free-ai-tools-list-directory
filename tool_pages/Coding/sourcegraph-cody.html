It utilizes Sourcegraph's code graph and Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide assistance. Cody has the ability to read through your entire codebase and other external resources like open-source code and StackOverflow questions to offer suggestions and answers based on prior knowledge.Some key features of Cody include:1. Chatbot that knows your code: Cody can write code and answer questions related to your project's codebase, following your coding standards and architecture better than other AI chatbots.2. Fixup code: Cody can interactively write and refactor code based on quick natural-language instructions provided by the developer.3. Recipes: Cody can generate unit tests, documentation, and more, considering the context of your entire codebase.4. Experimental completions: Cody can provide suggestions as you code.Cody can be used in various ways, such as through the Cody app, as an editor extension for VS Code and JetBrains, or by connecting it to a Sourcegraph enterprise instance. Developers can chat with Cody in the editor or the Sourcegraph sidebar to ask questions or provide fixup instructions. Cody will provide responses based on the code files it has read, and if it gives incorrect answers, feedback can be shared to help improve its accuracy.Overall, Cody aims to reduce toil and enhance developers' productivity by providing reliable code assistance and answering coding queries based on its extensive knowledge base.</p>
