The platform allows users to build and sell digital products in minutes. The AI-powered product builder removes the guesswork by guiding creators through the product creation process based on their expertise.

This allows creators to easily share their products across various platforms.

The access link has expiration time and can only be re-authenticated by the purchaser.In addition to its practical functionalities, The Leap aims to make learning as engaging as watching a TikTok video. It provides a new medium for creating bite-sized educational products designed for social media audiences and optimized for mobile consumption.Overall, The Leap offers a comprehensive end-to-end platform for creators to quickly create, launch, and sell digital products, eliminating the need for multiple tools or time-consuming processes.</p>
