            <h2>About Yelp Assistant</h2>
            <p>Yelp Assistant is a conversational AI feature that revolutionizes the method of discovering and engaging with service professionals. With a focus on helping users solve a diversity of projects within areas such as home, local, auto, beauty, pet, real estate, events, financial services and more, Yelp Assistant is designed to understand the user's needs and suggest service providers accordingly. This tool effectively guides users through the process of identifying the right professional for the job by understanding the context of your project or problem, and then matching it to businesses that are most suited to assist. Yelp Assistant differs from other solutions with its capability to accurately interpret your problem to identify the optimal provider. It largely relies on the large language models (LLMs) technology which is trained on Yelps extensive dataset, including Request a Quote, business information and others. Through a personalized conversation with the user, Yelp Assistant collects the necessary details a professional would need to evaluate your project, create a detailed project request, and send it on the user's behalf to relevant service providers. This results in better responses from businesses with accurate pricing and availability. Yelp Assistant can be accessed from the Projects tab on iOS and will be available on Android at a later date.</p>
