            <h2>About LectoMate</h2>
            <p>LectoMate is an AI-driven platform designed to transform lecture files into comprehensive study materials. It's aimed at aiding both students and educators in enhancing teaching and learning experiences. The primary functionality of this platform involves its capability to produce summarized key points, study guides, mind maps, flashcards, and tailored questions from uploaded lecture notes. Users are required to provide content by uploading their class lecture notes or slides. The AI-powered system then analyzes this content to generate various study resources. Additionally, the process involves lecture extraction and summarization by automatically extracting text from any PDFs, Word documents, or PowerPoints, analyzing it, and providing a concise summary highlighting key concepts. AI-generated flashcards focusing on key terms and definitions are also created from lecture summaries. LectoMate generates a mind map to help visualize relationships between topics and ideas. Additionally, it creates diverse quiz questions based on the concepts in the lecture notes. As part of its features, users have the ability to download the generated flashcards for further study. The entire process aims at optimizing lecture content for better understanding, studying, and retention.</p>
