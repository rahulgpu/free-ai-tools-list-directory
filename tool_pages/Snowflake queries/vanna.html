            <h2>About Vanna</h2>
            <p>Vanna is an AI-powered business intelligence assistant that connects to your Snowflake, BigQuery, or other database and helps you get insights from your data. Vanna uses natural language processing technology, allowing you to ask questions in plain English, without having to write SQL or Python queries. With every question you ask, Vanna improves its performance and evolves to become smarter. When you connect Vanna to your database, it learns the structure of your data and uses past queries as examples to generate new queries that answer your specific questions. Vanna can handle complex queries and is capable of providing insightful answers that can be highly accurate. Vanna is designed for businesses that are looking to improve their analytics capabilities without having to hire additional talent. The tool can help you expand your analytics capabilities and multiply your analysts by utilizing AI-powered features. Vanna offers a free forever plan, a premium beta plan for teams, and an enterprise plan for large-scale usage. While pricing for the premium and enterprise plans is yet to be decided, Vanna aims to maintain a free tier for low usage. Security is a top priority, and Vanna ensures that all connections are encrypted and that databases, queries, and models are isolated to the organization. Vanna supports Snowflake and can work with other databases with support coming soon.
