            <h2>About Deeper</h2>
            <p>Deeper: Relationship Questions is a tool intended to foster in-depth conversations, primarily used during date nights. The primary functionality of this tool revolves around generating random relationship questions powered by AI. It utilizes the latest iteration of the OpenAI's GPT-4 model to come up with these questions, providing a varied and insightful experience every time. The structure of the app is straightforward; users can engage with it without needing to create an account. This changes if users wish to purchase question credits, as an account is required for that. This credit system forms a key part of the app's functionality. Users buy question credits, and only when they've received or viewed a question is a credit deducted from their account. In cases of API timeouts, the app assures that credits will not be deducted. The tool is available on both iOS and Android platforms, with links provided to the respective stores. From an operational standpoint, it is designed to provide users with an experience that is user-friendly and intuitive. Detailed information pertaining to the app's terms of service and privacy policies are readily accessible, indicating transparency in operations. The tool also has established channels on social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, making communication with the users more streamlined and engaging. Overall, this tool provides a unique way to facilitate meaningful conversations through AI-powered, randomized questions.</p>
