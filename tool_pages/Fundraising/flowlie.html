            <h2>About Flowlie</h2>
            <p>Flowlie is an all-encompassing hub for fundraising purposes. It enables founders to construct an optimal cap table, design fundraising rounds, perform investor outreach, share pitch decks and one-pagers, and monitor investor engagement. Existing tools include Round Builder to guide the fundraising process, Dilution Calculator to project the value of shares and the percentage sold, and industry terminology to impress potential investors. Furthermore, Flowlie provides an investor database, personalized to each companys stage and style, to assist in identifying suitable investors. It also includes a unique AI-powered Deck Analyzer to test pitch decks prior to investor distribution. For sharing purposes, Flowlie offers a one-pager builder showcasing information to facilitate investor decisions and a method to share these via desktop or mobile. Its tracking abilities provide immediate feedback on investor engagement with shared information like pitch decks or one-pagers and allows founders to understand better who viewed their materials, for how long, and on what type of device. Flowlie also provides detailed profiles of each investor, highlighting their investment interests and areas of expertise. This tool is not a fundraising marketplace; instead, it is a fundraising automation and analytics platform. Its services are automated, but users are still responsible for engaging potential investors.</p>
