            <h2>About Church</h2>
            <p>Tensor Church is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to ask about religion, belief, or philosophy across multiple faiths. Its database is equipped with major religious books including the Bible, Quran, Book of Mormon, Bhagavad Gita, and Analects. It provides users with real-time responses to their inquiries and helps in acquiring more knowledge about religions from an objective perspective. Tensor Church has a user-friendly interface that allows users to chat directly with AI Scholar, who is trained to answer any questions related to religious beliefs or practices. This tool offers complete anonymity and does not store any personal information. As soon as the chat is over, all data is deleted from its servers. Tensor Church supports all languages, although its AI technology is trained on English. It is important to note that Tensor Church is still in the beta testing phase and is not a guaranteed source of accurate information. Users are encouraged to seek advice from religious leaders and professionals for any serious questions, and use Tensor Church as an additional source of information. Despite any limitations, Tensor Church remains a convenient and useful tool to acquire an objective overview of major religious beliefs.</p>
