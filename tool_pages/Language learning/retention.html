            <h2>About Retention</h2>
            <p>Retention is an AI-powered language study tool designed specifically for intermediate and advanced language learners. The tool is not game-based; it instead focuses on supplying fast-paced study exercises to help users maintain their language understanding and build on their existing knowledge. Users are exposed to a wide array of phrases across thousands of categories, providing exposure to new ideas and vocabulary. If users encounter unfamiliar words, they can get assistance from the tool, which in turn keeps track of these challenging words and endeavours to incorporate them in future study exercises for better reinforcement. An important feature of Retention is its AI-powered evaluation engine which offers feedback on each submitted exercise, allowing users to understand areas of improvement. The tool also keeps a track of the users' progress over time. It supports many languages like German, Russian, Spanish, Italian, Chinese and more. The tool operates on a monthly subscription basis that can be canceled at any time. Users are also allowed to submit language requests if they dont see their language listed.</p>
