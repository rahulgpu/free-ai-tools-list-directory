            <h2>About Praktika</h2>
            <p>Praktika is an AI language learning app that offers an automated 1-1 tutorship experience with generative AI Avatar Tutors. These AI tutors have been designed to interact with learners in a human-like manner, offering personalized lessons and practice sessions that can be accessed at any time, from anywhere. Praktika's avatars adapt to the learner's unique language skills and personal contexts, thereby optimizing the learning process. Moreover, as opposed to traditional language learning methods which can be costly and depend on the tutor's availability, Praktika ensures a low-pressure environment where learning English is made fun and accessible. The platform is also equipped to provide learners with real-time feedback after each session. Praktika boasts numerous lessons and characters which aid in understanding native dialects and reducing psycho-emotional pressure that can occur through highlighting learner's mistakes in a traditional learning setup. The app uses AI-powered algorithms that work with minimum latency and high accuracy to provide prompt and precise feedback, ensuring efficient language learning performance. Ultimately, Praktika bridges the gap between traditional language learning apps and human tutors, offering learners a reliable and effective tool to master English.</p>
