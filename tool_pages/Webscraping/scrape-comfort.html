            <p>Scrape Comfort is an AI scraper tool designed for hassle-free data mining and scraping from any website.

It allows users to input URLs through CSVs, Google Sheets, or plain text, making it flexible and convenient for data collection. With Scrape Comfort, users can download data from entered URLs using their own browser, including pages that require JavaScript for rendering. The tool allows users to track the progress of downloads and provides options to display or hide the browser during the process. Setting up data extractors is made simple through a dropdown menu, where users can define in plain text what data they need to extract from the downloaded pages. The extraction progress can be monitored throughout the process. The extracted data can be saved in various formats, such as clipboard or CSV file, for immediate use.
