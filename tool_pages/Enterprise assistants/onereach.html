            <h2>About OneReach</h2>
            <p>OneReach is an AI tool that utilizes Intelligent Digital Workers (IDWs). The IDWs are essentially generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) that function alongside other technologies to perform various tasks. These tasks could involve creation, organization, and prioritizing, functioning towards providing more time for teams. These IDWs converse in different languages through several channels to perform real work. They serve as digital assistants, which contain a set of shared skills across teams and organizations and form the basis of hyperautomation. Creating an Intelligent Digital Worker only requires conversation, without necessitating a technical background or understanding of development. IDWs are trained by customizing and learning from existing skill sets; these digital assistants come with skills 'out of the box.' You can also add to their abilities from a library of recommendations or create own skills. IDWs use machine learning to access and manage varying information sources that a user interacts with, such as email, appointments, web pages, and files. They are proactive, providing users with information and seeking additional information autonomously. Furthermore, IDWs can assist in document creation by leveraging structure and content knowledge from existing documents. Lastly, IDWs can automate routine tasks like travel authorizations or expense tracking, and can learn new tasks by collaborating with users.</p>
