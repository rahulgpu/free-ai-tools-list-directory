            <h2>About Gamelight &#8211; AI-Backed Mobile Marketing</h2>
            <p>Gamelight is a User Acquisition (UA) platform designed specifically for mobile games. The key feature of Gamelight is its ability to drive direct gamers traffic from its self-published game recommendation platform. It incorporates a range of extensive targeting options including age, gender, vertical, lookalike and competitor game targeting to tunnel down and reach the intended audience. Gamelight employs advanced algorithms to analyse app usage data and user gaming behaviour to understand their gaming preferences and playtime. The platform uses this data to create detailed user profiles based on their gaming behaviour and demographic data. Upon doing so, it facilitates personalized game recommendations to match these user profiles, enhancing their overall gaming experience. Another intriguing feature of Gamelight is its Reward Algorithm. It incentivizes users to play games, earning them points that can be exchanged for gift cards and vouchers. This approach to user engagement and retention fosters a dedicated fanbase for immersive gaming experiences. Gamelight's Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) Algorithm also analyzes usage data to identify users most likely to make a purchase, thereby putting it at a clear advantage over other UA sources.</p>
