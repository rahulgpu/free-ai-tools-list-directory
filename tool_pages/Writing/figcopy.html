            <h2>About FigCopy</h2>
            <p>FigCopy is a productivity enhancing plugin designed for those who regularly work with designs. It is targeted towards helping users eliminate the use of placeholder or 'dummy' text in their designs by allowing them to generate and use 'real copy.' The real copy provided by FigCopy can be personalized according to the specific products or services that are being designed for, offering a touch of customization. This tool is not only beneficial for designers but is also intended to impress clients or managers with the authenticity of design previews. In addition to producing real copy, FigCopy is also developing new features set to be released in the future. These include functionality for conducting A/B testing on copy as well as templates which users can experiment with and use in their design work. To use this plugin, it must be installed from the Figma community, and an API key is provided to get started. JavaScript must also be enabled in the user's browser settings. The tool does not appear fixed in pricing, given a $0+ option that includes limited access and a paid version that grants unlimited usage. Despite these details, it's crucial to check the most recent updates through their purchase platform to know the current prices and offerings. Note that FigCopy requires an active subscription, deemed through its pricing arrangement.</p>
