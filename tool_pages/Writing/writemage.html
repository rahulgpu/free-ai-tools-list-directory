            <h2>About WriteMage</h2>
            <p>WriteMage is a macOS and iOS app that integrates AI into your workflow. The application features the powerful ChatGPT model and its application is extended to function natively within your devices. Key features include the ability to use context-aware ChatGPT in any app, eliminating the need for copying and pasting. The app functions by floating on top of any active application, much like Apple Spotlight. Another major feature is the storage of all your chat history locally, with labeling options for easy reference and continuation of past conversations. In addition, WriteMage has the capability to remember the context within a conversation session and respond accordingly. It also offers a Prompt Editor GUI feature that allows users to customize their prompts as per their requirements. Furthermore, WriteMage is also integrated natively with iOS keyboard and is accessible in all apps within the app store. An in-app purchase in WriteMage iOS facilitates users to apply their own API keys. A unique aspect of WriteMage is that it has been developed to bypass Apple's restrictions on iOS, resulting in an app that provides valuable utility to its users.</p>
