            <h2>About LivingWriter</h2>
            <p>LivingWriter is an advanced manuscript writing and organization platform. It allows authors and novelists to create, structure, and organize their books, screenplays, academic papers, and manuscripts for easy publishing. The tool provides advanced capabilities, where users can drag and drop to order and reorder sections, outlines, chapters, and elements, making manuscript organization quick and straightforward. A standout feature is the on-screen sidebar which provides immediate access to notes, elements, goals, and comments. Another important feature is the 'LivingWriter Boards'. The boards allow a comprehensive overview of the entire manuscript, elements, and research, making drafting and organizing a breeze. A unique offering is the AI Outline Generator, which assists authors in structuring their books by providing templates from a wide spectrum of genres. This tool tailors the structure and outlines based on the information fed to it. This allows for well-structured and coherent books and narratives. One distinctive feature exclusive to this platform is the 'Smart Text and Auto-Suggest', which auto-suggests elements like character names, locations, and objects in the manuscript and users can access detailed notes for each of these elements. Lastly, the tool also includes writing goals and stats to help writers stay on track and motivated. LivingWriter emphasizes on privacy by ensuring the data is deleted after every session and also mentions that the data won't be used for AI training.</p>
