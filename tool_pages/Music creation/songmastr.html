            <h2>About Songmastr</h2>
            <p>Songmastr is an artificial intelligence-based tool designed for automatic song mastering. It allows users to master their songs to match a commercial reference track. The platform emphasizes the importance of uploading a well-mixed song and advises users to leave some volume headroom in their mixed track. Stereo compression can be applied but it discourages the application of a limiter, as limiting will be conducted during mastering. This service offers users the guide to choosing a reference track that must be within the same genre and vibe as the user's song. If the user's song is a beat or instrumental track, a reference without a singer is preferable. For the mastering process to kick off, users are required to upload a song from their computer after which they are redirected to the download page. Once the processing is done, the mastered file can be downloaded. A major advantage of Songmastr is that it is based on an open-source library named Matchering. The AI system used in Songmastr masters tracks to match the RMS, frequency response, peak amplitude, and stereo width of the chosen reference track. This tool is free for mastering up to seven songs per week with no software or registration required. It is important to note that it accepts song files that do not exceed 10 minutes and 80MB, to prevent server saturation.</p>
