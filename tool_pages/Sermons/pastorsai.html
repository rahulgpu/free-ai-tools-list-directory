            <h2>About PastorsAI</h2>
            <p>Pastors.AI is an AI tool that allows users to create custom chatbots based on YouTube videos of church services. With this tool, users can repurpose their sermons, create sermon summaries with timestamped links, generate insightful quotes, develop 5-day devotionals, and create sermon-based discussion and question guides for small groups. Additionally, users can upload sermon manuscripts and create resources before Sunday services. One of the key features of Pastors.AI is the ability to ask questions to a custom chatbot that is trained on all the sermons and website information of a particular church. This chatbot is designed to provide in-depth responses and even offers time-stamped links for further exploration. Users can make the most out of their pastor's sermon by leveraging this tool to create resources that extend beyond Sunday morning. Pastors.AI offers different pricing options to cater to the needs of various churches. The demo version provides limited access, allowing users to create chatbots and access features such as sermon summaries, sermon quotes for social media, discussion guides, and devotionals. Individual and church plans offer additional benefits like creating chatbots from manuscripts, access to chatbots of other churches, custom chatbot training, chat widget integration, and reporting options. Overall, Pastors.AI is a valuable tool for churches to maximize the impact of their sermons and create engaging resources for their congregation.</p>
