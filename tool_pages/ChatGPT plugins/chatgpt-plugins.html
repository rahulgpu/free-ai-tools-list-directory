            <h2>About ChatGPT plugins</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT plugins is a tool designed for ChatGPT, a language model AI tool, to provide users with additional functionality and access to up-to-date information, or third-party services. Plugins are designed with safety as a core principle and are gradually being rolled out to a small group of users first to study their impact, safety, and alignment challenges. The first set of plugins have been created by leading companies such as Expedia, Klarna, Slack, and Wolfram, and there are also plugins for a web browser and code interpreter. The plugins function as "eyes and ears" for language models, giving them access to more personalized or specific information that is not included in their training data. They provide additional functionality beyond emitting text, enabling the language model to run computations, access up-to-date information, or interact with third-party services. ChatGPT plugins will gradually roll out to more users over time, and developers who have been invited from the waitlist can use the provided documentation to build their own plugins. Additionally, the code for a knowledge base retrieval plugin has been open-sourced, providing developers with the option to self-host the plugin. The ChatGPT plugins are designed to provide the community with the opportunity to shape the interaction paradigm between humans and AI.</p>
