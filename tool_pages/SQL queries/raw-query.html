            <h2>About Raw Query</h2>
            <p>Raw Query is an artificial intelligence tool designed to facilitate direct communication with databases using conversational language. This tool allows users, whether they are developers or business intelligence professionals, to interact with their databases as if they were speaking to a colleague. By utilizing natural language processing, Raw Query simplifies complex database queries, data entry, updates, and exports without the need for traditional database querying languages or the development of internal tools. The core functionality of Raw Query includes querying data, adding new data entries, and updating existing information. For instance, users can easily retrieve the email addresses of recent clients, insert new sales data, or modify client information directly through conversational inputs. This process not only minimizes the learning curve associated with database management but also significantly reduces the time typically spent on creating and managing multiple internal tools. Raw Query's design emphasizes ease of use, with a simple setup process where users need only provide a connection string to begin interacting with their database. This accessibility makes it particularly appealing to non-technical users who require quick data interactions without deep technical expertise. Moreover, Raw Query is adaptable to various business sizes and needs, offering several subscription plans that cater to different user volumes and database requirements. Each plan is tailored to accommodate everything from individual founders to large teams, ensuring scalability and flexibility. This tool is particularly beneficial for users looking to streamline database management tasks, enhance productivity, and eliminate the traditional complexities associated with database interactions.</p>
