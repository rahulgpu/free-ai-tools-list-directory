            <h2>About SeamlessExpressive</h2>
            <p>Seamless Communication Translation is a demonstration product of AI-powered translation research conducted by Meta AI. Catering to a wide variety of languages, the tool is able to translate from a large number of input languages into a significantly diverse set of output languages. One of the distinguishing features of this AI model, named SeamlessExpressive, is its ability to maintain the expressive elements of speech style in the translation. This includes aspects like pitch and volume, and emotional tone such as excitement, sadness, or whispering. Additionally, it reflects speech style elements like speech rate and pauses. This feature enables users to create translations that closely follow their unique speech style, providing a more personalised and expressive communication experience. The tool includes a demo for users to experience its functionality, as well as links to the research and the tool’s Github repository for those interested in its technical aspects. As this is a research demo, users are required to be at least 18 years old and accept the supplemental terms of service. It is a forward-looking tool that seeks to redefine the boundaries of AI-driven translation and communication.</p>
