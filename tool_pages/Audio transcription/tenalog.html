            <h2>About Tenalog</h2>
            <p>Tenalog™ is a powerful tool designed for busy SLPs (Speech-Language Pathologists) who want to streamline their documentation process and focus more on their patients. With Tenalog™, SLPs can record their therapy sessions using Ambiki's HIPAA-compliant recorder. The tool then automatically generates a variety of documentation including a detailed transcript, error analysis, visit notes, progress tracking, parent-friendly summaries, and session planning for the next visit.The tool simplifies the documentation process by automatically generating a detailed transcript with precise timestamps and speaker labels. It also analyzes the pronunciation of significant patient words and phrases, down to the phoneme level. SLPs can benefit from automatically generated visit notes based on the audio transcript, which includes a detailed speech sound chart.Progress tracking is made easy with Tenalog™ as the tool extracts structured data from the session and ties it back to the patient's goals. SLPs can view progress through beautiful goal-level progress charts, articulation charts, and even revisit patient progress through a history of audio clips.Tenalog™ also offers session planning for the next visit by automatically generating session plan ideas based on the previous session. Relevant resources and activity lists from Ambiki's library of therapy tools are recommended to support session planning.Additionally, Tenalog™ provides reference links for further research, listing evidence-based practice (EBP) references based on the content of the session and the goals being worked on.Overall, Tenalog™ helps SLPs save time and effort with its automated documentation features, allowing them to focus more on delivering quality therapy to their patients.</p>
