By scrutinizing your data 24/7, it offers insights for more effective use of your ad budget and enables more strategic decision-making.

The tool goes beyond surface-level insights, and proactively investigates significant findings, allowing you to stay in tune with changes without the necessity for constant manual oversight. Blobr also features the ability to search for insights in natural language - meaning you can ask questions like a business person and get results like an analyst, without the need for technical expertise. Blobrs artificial intelligence capabilities evolve over time, continuously refining analyses as it learns more about your unique business and data patterns. Once Blobr is set up, you can connect your apps with a single click and receive a daily report based on the insights found by the AI. Additionally, the ability to ask questions allows for a deeper understanding of the generated insights.</p>
