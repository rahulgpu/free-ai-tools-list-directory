            <h2>About Lina.Place</h2>
            <p>LINA is a mobile app that intertwines art therapy with artificial intelligence to offer a unique support to mental health. The application focuses on providing resources and activities for personal growth and self-love enhancement. Users interact with the app by following prompts to create simple drawings, which are then assessed by AI technology to provide insights into the creator's personality. Uniquely developed by art therapists, the activities within LINA are designed based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy principles to enhance user's self-confidence and foster a newfound self-understanding. Alongside art therapy, the application further provides resources such as journaling prompts; associative, metaphorical cards for internal advice seeking; and self-worth boosting meditations. Users appreciate the nurturing and calming atmosphere of the app, and its ability to elicit deeper self-awareness and understanding through a unique and creative platform. The therapeutic benefits of using LINA range from exploration and expression of feelings, increased self-awareness, enhanced verbal and non-verbal communication, problem-solving skill development, and considerable relief from stress and anxiety.</p>
