            <h2>About ScribeBerry</h2>
            <p>Scribeberry is an AI-powered medical dictation and transcription tool that helps healthcare professionals minimize time spent on generating medical notes, charting, consult letters, and other healthcare records. The tool provides a smart solution that leverages large language models and artificial intelligence to transcribe audio files and generate notes and outputs based on the medical templates that can be selected or personalized by the user. Scribeberry promises to increase clinic efficiency by simplifying the documentation process, allowing healthcare providers to focus more on patient care. Users can upload recorded audio files, dictate into the platform, or use text-based information to feed the tool and have it generate comprehensive notes that can be edited and customized. Scribeberry's notes can be transferred to any device or copied and pasted easily, and while there is no direct integration with existing EMR systems, the notes transfer seamlessly with a simple click and paste approach. The app is currently in early-preview and is free to use with unlimited access, and privacy and data security measures are in place to maintain confidentiality and integrity. Users can expect to save several hours per day using this tool, and Scribeberry offers troubleshooting support and welcomes feedback for further improvement.</p>
