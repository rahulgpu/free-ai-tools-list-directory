            <h2>About Photocode</h2>
            <p>Photocode is an AI coding assistant tool that uses the power of artificial intelligence to help users understand and debug code. It allows users to simply take a photo of the code or select it from their gallery, and the AI analyzes and explains the code. Even handwritten code on paper can be recognized by Photocode. The tool supports over a dozen popular programming languages and provides explanations in more than twenty human languages.Photocode also offers the capability to share code explanations, along with the photo of the code, with colleagues or friends on various platforms. It includes a built-in text-to-speech feature that can read the explanations out loud. The app saves code analyses to history automatically, allowing users to review them at any time. Bookmarks and smart filtering features make it easy to navigate through previous entries.Designed for a wide range of users including students, professors, software developers, and project managers, Photocode is a valuable tool for learning and understanding programming concepts. The app has a modern and slick design with customizable theme options, providing a pleasant user experience.Photocode has recently improved its code explanation analysis and code debug analysis features. It now also includes a popup for checking updates and adds social media handles to shared analysis and the "about" page. The app prioritizes data safety, with no data shared with third parties and no data collected. The developer provides a privacy policy for transparency.</p>
