            <h2>About Sequel AI</h2>
            <p>Sequel AI is an innovative tool designed as a personal AI longevity assistant that assists users in understanding their health, promoting longevity, and offering personalized insights based on the health data provided. This AI tool is capable of integrating varied health data, such as blood labs, MRI, DEXA scans, supplement intake, and pharmaceuticals history. All of this information is processed locally on the user's device, ensuring an uncompromised level of privacy. Sequel presents two options for its users - a completely local model that guarantees absolute data privacy, and a more advanced option that is powered by OpenAI. The user can opt for either model based on their preferences. The AI tool then uses this data to generate customized therapy and supplement recommendations, among other health-focused advice. This empowers the users to potentially enhance their well-being by following a health path tailored to their specific needs. Please note that Sequel is an open-source technology that aims to make health management more accessible and secure. However, it does not provide medical advice and should only be used for informational purposes.</p>
