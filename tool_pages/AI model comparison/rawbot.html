            <h2>About Rawbot</h2>
            <p>Rawbot is an AI tool designed for the straightforward comparison of various AI models. The primary objective of this tool is to support researchers, developers, and businesses in identifying the most suitable AI model for their specific needs. Rawbot is capable of examining and comparing an array of AI models based on different factors like performance, efficiency, suitability and resource requirements. By providing comparative analysis, it helps users make an informed decision based on rational data and analysis, rather than on guesswork or intuition. It eliminates the need to manually assess each model individually, thereby saving time and reducing complexity. The use of Rawbot potentially enhances the integral stages of AI development process, from the choice of model right through its implementation. The tool calls for JavaScript enabled in your browser to function effectively. Despite its sophisticated functionality, the interface of Rawbot is designed to be user-friendly, making it simple even for those who are less experienced in the field of AI. It's important to note that Rawbot doesn't favour any specific AI model; instead, it provides an unbiased evaluation to help users make the best possible choice based on their unique requirements.</p>
