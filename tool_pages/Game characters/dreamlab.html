            <h2>About Dreamlab</h2>
            <p>Dreamlab is an AI-powered tool that allows users to create animated game sprites quickly and easily. It leverages the concept of rotoscope animation, which was first developed in 1915 and used by pioneers like Walt Disney to achieve lifelike motion in films. Dreamlab's unique feature is its ability to generate characters based on a simple description provided by the user.The tool offers a built-in multiplayer game creator, enabling users to bring their assets to life within the platform. Alternatively, assets can be exported for use in external software. Dreamlab does not involve any blockchain or NFT functionality.Dreamlab supports various image generation methods, including Stable Diffusion 1.5 and 2.1. Additionally, users have the flexibility to incorporate their own models, LoRAs, and embeddings, among others.The release of Dreamlab started in early April 2023, with a gradual rollout of the animation tool. The development team is actively working on expanding its capabilities, such as level editing and multiplayer functionalities, which are scheduled to be available in the near future.Passionate AI creators can contribute to Dreamlab by joining the waitlist, trying out the tool, and providing feedback. The team plans to release open-source components as part of Dreamlab and collaborate with the community to enhance the tool's functionality. Stay updated by joining their Discord community.</p>
