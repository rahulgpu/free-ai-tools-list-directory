            <h2>About HealthFood AI</h2>
            <p>The "Create Next App" tool is an AI-powered application that generates personalized dish ideas based on user responses to a series of questions. Designed by @juanimolfino, the tool aims to recommend a suitable diet plan by considering various factors such as age, gender, activity level, workout preferences, dietary preferences, food intolerances, allergies, cooking skill level, time availability, and language preference.Users begin by providing information about their height, weight, age, gender identity, and current activity level. They are then prompted to select their preferred type of workout activity, the number of times they work out in a week, and the duration of their workouts. Next, users specify their main goal, such as weight loss or muscle mass gain.Dietary preferences, including vegetarianism, veganism, and pescetarianism, can be indicated. Users can also express their preferences for specific types of food, such as lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, dairy, green vegetables, legumes, and beans. Furthermore, users have the option to disclose any food intolerances or allergies they have.The tool also considers users' skill level in the kitchen and their willingness to prepare more elaborate meals or opt for simple and quick options. And finally, users can select their preferred language for response.Once all the information is provided, the tool generates personalized dish ideas based on the user's specific profile and preferences. This AI-based application aims to simplify and streamline the process of meal planning by tailoring recommendations to individual needs, facilitating healthy eating choices.</p>
