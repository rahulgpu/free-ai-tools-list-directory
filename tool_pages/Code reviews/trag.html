            <h2>About Trag</h2>
            <p>Trag is an AI-powered code review tool designed to optimize the code review process. Trag works by pre-reviewing the code and identifying issues before they are reviewed by a senior engineer, thus speeding up the review process and saving engineering time. Furthermore, unlike standard linting tools, Trag offers several notable features including in-depth code understanding, semantic code analysis, proactive bug detection, and refactoring suggestions, ensuring the quality and efficiency of the code. Trag also offers flexibility by allowing users to create and implement their own rules using natural language, matching these rules with pull request changes and auto-fixing those issues. Teams can utilize its analytics feature to monitor pull request analytics for better decision-making. You can connect multiple repositories and have different rules tracking them, this is made to offer high level of customization from repository to repository. One other way of thinking about Trag is as if it's a superlinter. The rules that you write can be enforced on any language any framework. Here a small set of already defined rules by our team: https://app.usetrag.com/rules Please try it out, we appreciate your feedback!</p>
