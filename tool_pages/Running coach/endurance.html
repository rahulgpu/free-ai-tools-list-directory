It also allows users to add their race goals, and the AI coach then optimizes the training schedule for peak performance on race day.Endurance looks at the athlete's workout history stored in Apple Health to build an intelligent model of their current fitness, training load, and recovery, just like a real coach. Users can track their upcoming race goals and obtain reliable race time predictions to achieve better results on race day. The app provides a comprehensive feature for athletes to keep a detailed record of their workouts, analyse their data, and monitor their progress.Endurance is available on iPhone and Apple Watch.
