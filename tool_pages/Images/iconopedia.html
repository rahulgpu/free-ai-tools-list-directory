            <h2>About Iconopedia</h2>
            <p>Iconopedia is an AI-enhanced tool designed to generate high-quality images instantly. As a perfect solution for those needing professional and compelling visuals, it allows users to say goodbye to endless searches and time-consuming manual edits. This tool is beneficial for anyone, be it creatives, freelancers, or corporates, who are looking for a streamlined process to get images. After signing in with a Google account, users are granted credits to generate images directly from the platform. Iconopedia operates on a credit system, with no limit to the number of images users can create as long as they have credits. It's also noteworthy that the generated images are commercially usable, granting full ownership rights to the users. Therefore, they can be incorporated into projects, marketing materials and more. While refunds are not offered due to the costs associated with generating the images, users can be assured of receiving precisely what they need for their projects, thus eliminating wasted time. Users can also readily reach out to Iconopedia's support team for any additional queries.</p>
