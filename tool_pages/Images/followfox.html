These checkpoints serve as a basis for generating end-to-end experiences with the Distillery tool.To learn how to use Distillery effectively, users can refer to the detailed guide available on the official Distillery website. Additionally, there is an active Discord community where users can join to interact with others and receive support.FollowFox also showcases their work through a gallery on their website, allowing users to scroll through examples of their generated images. They maintain a blog on Substack, where they share insights and updates related to their work.For further engagement, users can reach out to FollowFox via email for any inquiries or contact them through their social media presence. The tool is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to write a prompt and receive the generated image results.Distillery by FollowFox offers developers and other users the opportunity to leverage their text-to-image generation capabilities, particularly in scenarios requiring smaller AI models with local or edge computing capabilities.</p>
