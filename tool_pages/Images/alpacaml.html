            <h2>About AlpacaML</h2>
            <p>AlpacaML is an AI rendering engine designed for artists and creative professionals. It helps to transform initial sketches into finished drafts rapidly, while providing seamless editing and iteration features. The tool aims to balance creative boundary pushing and integrity preservation. It comprehends artist's intent and works with their sketches, color palette, and unique art style to produce compelling renditions. This includes the ability to instantly render and style sketches, and generate texture and detail to any material with a simple click. Alpaca's functionality also extends to easy integration of feedback, offering non-destructive rendering over edits and paintovers for efficient and seamless iterations. Features like Generation Masks allow for selective rendering of paintovers and edits, while the layer system keeps workflows organized. Alpaca also accommodates personalized configuration through Alpaca Chroma, where reference images can be used to shape the generation style. Other features include a provision for unlimited generation with paid plans, digital landscape and character morphing features, and rendering controls for the degree of image change during generation. Alpaca also offers appropriateness for team deployment, with features for shared custom model creation and data privacy assurances ensuring no public generation or asset training occurs. It positions itself as a tool that aligns with artist workflow and preferences and aims to integrate technology efficiently with creativity.</p>
