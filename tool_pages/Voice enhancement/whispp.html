            <h2>About Whispp</h2>
            <p>Whispp is an AI-driven technology primarily aimed at aiding people with speech impediments and severe stuttering. This tool showcases innovative assistive voice technology, designed to convert whispers or vocal cord impaired speech into clear, natural voices. The technology ultimately aims to enhance communication by offering a more relaxed and confident speaking experience, regardless of the particularity of one's voice disability. Whispp allows users to reach anyone on their mobile or fixed number without requiring the other person to have the app installed. In addition, the platform provides the option of personalizing the voice that is produced, striving to retain a semblance of the user's unique vocal identity. A distinct feature is that it allows recordings so that the generated Whispp voice can mimic one's own healthy voice, delivering a more personal touch. Moreover, the tool offers services for various situations, from personal use to professional settings, enabling individuals to communicate more effectively in their work environment. It is scientifically indicated that people who stutter severely show a significant reduction in their stuttering frequency while using Whispp. Useful for individuals and speech therapists, Whispp provides practical support for communication both during and post-treatment. This tool is acknowledged for its commitment to making communication more accessible, with recognition in the form of a CES Innovation Award for Accessibility.</p>
