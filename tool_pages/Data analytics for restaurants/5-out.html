            <h2>About 5-Out</h2>
            <p>5-Out is a restaurant forecasting tool that uses artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to maximize profitability. It integrates with numerous systems restaurant owners already use, such as point of sale, labor scheduling, purchasing and inventory, weather, social media, ordering, and news and events. One of its core functions is accurate sales predictions, allowing for optimization of labor and purchasing based on these forecasts. It offers predictive intelligence that anticipates what the business will sell and when, approximately up to 21 days in advance, providing insights with high confidence. From these predictions, 5-Out suggests real-time staffing and purchasing actions to increase profitability. The system also includes lookback reports that track weekly and daily performance over time, providing valuable insights that enable stronger decision-making. Its real-time insights help adjust labor scheduling and purchasing decisions based on current data and observations. The tool also promises a swift setup process and seamless integration with pre-existing systems, requiring no onboarding or employee setup, and no need to replace any current software.</p>
