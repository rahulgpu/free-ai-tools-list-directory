            <h2>About Be My Eyes</h2>
            <p>Be My Eyes is a free mobile application that connects blind, low-vision, and visually-impaired users with sighted volunteers and professional support, enabling them to receive immediate visual assistance via live video chat. This simple, easy-to-use app can significantly enhance the daily living of visually-challenged individuals, by helping them overcome various obstacles, such as reading instructions, distinguishing colors, navigating new surroundings, or checking expiry dates. Recently, a new feature has been added, called "Virtual Volunteer" that is powered by OpenAI's GPT-4. It enables users to send images via the app to an AI-powered Virtual Volunteer, which instantly provides identification, interpretation, and conversational visual assistance for a wide variety of tasks. Besides its main purpose, Be My Eyes also supports corporate volunteering and offers a suite of business solutions that can bring inclusivity and accessibility to companies of all sizes, from virtual volunteering for employees to video support tools for CX teams. Also, Be My Eyes is currently running a GoFundMe campaign to develop a wearable device that would provide hands-free video cameras to any low-vision students across the globe for free. Overall, Be My Eyes is a valuable tool that promotes social inclusivity, empowering people with visual impairments to overcome daily challenges, and enhancing their abilities to lead more independent lives.</p>
