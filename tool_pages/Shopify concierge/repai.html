            <h2>About RepAI</h2>
            <p>Rep AI is an AI-powered chatbot designed to enhance the shopping experience for customers in an eCommerce store. It was specifically built for Shopify and uses two AIs to provide shoppers with a personalised guided shopping experience. The Rescue Algorithm predicts when a shopper is about to leave the site, with an accuracy rate of 92%, and engages them in a conversation to bring them back. ChatGPT powers the conversational shopping assistant to handle all conversations, including product questions, checkout and recommendations. Rep AI understands natural language and idioms, thus making it ideal for big catalogue stores with complex queries. It can recommend complementary products for upsells and can handle multiple languages. Rep AI integrates with popular Shopify apps seamlessly, and requires no changes to the support stack. Merchants have reported increased Conversion Rates of up to 13%, Average Order Value increment of 20%, and an average sales increase of 9%. Rep AI provides customers with a tailored shopping experience, making it a game-changer for eCommerce sales. Brands such as Underoutfit have seen an exponential increase in their conversion rate. Rep AI offers a 30-day free trial and a 60-day money-back guarantee if the user does not get 10x ROI on their investment.</p>
