            <p>Anima is an AI-powered tool geared towards enhancing the design-to-development workflow. It allows for seamless conversion of design to code with platform compatibility to Figma, XD, and Sketch which can be transformed to React, Vue, and HTML. This tool automates design system through connection of Storybook to Figma. Users can also create advanced level prototypes directly within the designing platforms. Additionally, Anima comes with a VS CODE BETA that enables users to inspect Figma files and produce React codes in VS Code. This feature makes the tool extremely developer-friendly by letting them skip tedious tasks and hasten production with automated front-end code that they can effectively utilize.A unique feature within Anima is AI code personalization through the GenAI engine. This feature allows users to customize the produced code to resemble their unique coding style or guidelines. Anima also offers interactive and responsive prototype design and working code handoff with its Figma to Code plugin. Users also have the capability to generate personalized, production-ready code within Figma. Anima stands out with its compatibility - it enables easy integration within existing workflows as it doesn't enforce adoption of new methods, allowing teams begin working immediately. This tool has the trust of product teams from well-known companies such as Apple, Netflix, Amazon, Adobe, and Walmart.</p>
