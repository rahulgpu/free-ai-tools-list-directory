            <h2>About Paxo</h2>
            <p>Paxo is an AI tool designed to simplify taking meeting notes through artificial intelligence. It provides clear, concise, and actionable notations from in-person interactions and is ideal for face-to-face or virtual meetings. One of the prominent features of Paxo is its ability to automatically record, identify speakers, and generate notes, ensuring no key decision or action points are overlooked. It learns the voice of everyone in a team over time and helps in assigning speakers for future recordings. Paxo takes a privacy-first approach, storing recordings on the user's device rather than on a cloud, and deletes them from its servers immediately after processing. This makes Paxo not only efficient but also secure for confidential meetings. It's a mobile-friendly tool, offering the flexibility to use anywhere and anytime. It can be conveniently left on a desk during a Zoom call or taken along for a walk. Paxo also provides users the flexibility to import and export data, allowing for easy transition of notes and recordings. It syncs recordings across all devices through iCloud, ensuring your data is secure even if you lose your device. All recordings are organized and searchable, promoting repetitive need for clarity in conversations. Additionally, it fosters better work collaboration by letting users share and import their data into and from apps like Notion, Obsidian, and Google Docs. Constant updates and improvements are part of Paxo's package, providing users with new features regularly. User support for any technical difficulty is also provided.</p>
