Interior AI could become an intriguing new tool for interior design ideation, or even real estate virtual staging" -Fast Compay "I have been using Interior AI in my interior design process and it has been magical. @levelsio created a tool where you can upload an image of a room and within seconds the room is staged with furniture, lighting and accessories🤯" -Isabelle Orsi (interior designer) "Turns out that @levelsio is working on something like this over at Interior AI. (I don't know who holds the Stripe-wide record for operating the largest number of distinct businesses, but strongly suspect @levelsio is the 🐐.) -Patrick Collison (founder of Stripe) "Interior AI is a neural network to create realistic 3D models of interiors. Interior AI can be used in a variety of interior design areas, including residential, hotel and restaurant interior design." - Dare # The most detailed AI Room Designer available Interior AI is capable of extreme detail in its interior designs using the latest tech breakthroughs in high resolution AI image generation and we keep making it better. # Create 3d flythroughs with AI Take any AI interior design you rendered, and turn it into a 3d flythrough video. A few minutes later you have a video clip of the interior design giving you an immersive virtual reality like experience. Interior AI is an official launch partner of Stable Video Diffusion and use their tech to turn images into video. # Transform your sketches and SketchUp into photorealistic renders With Interior AI's Sketch2Image™ you can now create photorealistic renders from your raw interior design sketches. Imagine doing a quick draft of an idea you have. Upload it to Interior AI and ~30 seconds later you have a realistic AI photo of how it'd look in real life. A photorealistic render you can use to show to your clients so they can imagine how it looks better. # Virtual Staging AI: fill empty homes for real estate listings Virtually staged homes sell 87% faster and for 15% higher prices than empty homes. On average that means $70,000 more, or $3,500 in extra income for the real estage agent. An average agent that sells 10 homes per year on avg makes $35,000 extra income per year. Interior AI's Pro plan lets you stage 1,000 times per month with the Virtual Staging AI feature for only $390/year! Using Artificial Intelligence, the app can detect the construction of a room (walls, ceiling, beams) and generate interior design ideas and mockups. It can also be used to virtually stage interiors in different styles, such as Chinese New Year, Modern, Minimalist, Scandinavian, Contemporary, Midcentury Modern, Zen, Tropical, Industrial, Biophilic, Art Deco, Farmhouse, Bohemian, Vintage, Rustic, Japanese Design, Cottagecore, Coastal, French Country, Art Nouveau, Cyberpunk, Maximalist, Baroque, Christmas, Gaming Room, Ski Chalet, Sketch, Vaporwave, Tribal, Medieval, Halloween, Easter, and Neoclassical. Interior AI also allows users to upload images of their current interiors to generate ideas and mockups, with the option of creating high resolution or low resolution renders. For added privacy, users can upgrade to Pro and get their own private workspace and render HQ renders without watermark and deletion.</p>
