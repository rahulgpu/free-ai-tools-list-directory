            <h2>About Jelli</h2>
            <p>Jelli.io is an AI-driven platform that aids in redesigning interior spaces. It utilizes AI technology to virtually modify the appearance of a room by rearranging furniture and altering decor. The tool works by asking users to upload a photo of their space and choose an aesthetic theme that fits their preferences. From there, Jelli.io begins the redesign process. The platform offers three key services: room redesign, virtual staging, and furniture replacement. Room redesign introduces fresh ideas into your existing space, potentially transforming its overall look and feel. Virtual staging brings to life empty rooms by digitally adding furniture and decorations. This allows users to see what their room might resemble fully furnished with a specific design style. Furniture replacement, meanwhile, focuses on changing specific items within a room. Users can swap specific pieces to explore different combinations. Jelli.io's adaptability applies to various settings, ideal for those thinking about repainting, refurnishing, or simply extracting more potential from their interiors. Moreover, users can tweak their designs by virtually painting over specific areas in the room and replacing individual items for more tailored results. Jelli.io is a free tool with limitations in the form of watermarked images. To achieve watermark-free images and more personalized services, users have the option to purchase additional credits. All these capabilities put together make Jelli.io a versatile AI-powered environment for interior redesign, providing users the freedom to explore design ideas for their spaces.</p>
