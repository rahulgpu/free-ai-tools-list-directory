            <h2>About Tappy</h2>
            <p>Tappy is an AI browser extension designed to assist LinkedIn users in adding thoughtful comments to posts with just one tap. Unlike other AI browser extensions, Tappy boasts exceptional comment quality. This tool is primarily used for sales prospecting, as it allows users to engage with recent LinkedIn posts from potential prospects, thereby maintaining their visibility. Tappy also enables users to enhance their personal branding by leaving comments on posts by other content creators, thereby increasing their own visibility and growing their audience. Furthermore, Tappy can be utilized for job hunting purposes, as users can engage with job postings and managers on LinkedIn to increase their visibility as a potential candidate. In terms of data privacy, the Tappy Chrome extension only has access to data from LinkedIn.com and Tappy.ai URLs, with data collection limited to the text of the posts and comments made by the user. Tappy does not analyze all LinkedIn content while scrolling. The tool utilizes end-to-end encryption for data in transit and storage, and it does not store any useful data to sell. Tappy is available exclusively as a Chrome Extension and offers a free account that is limited to five comments per day. Upgrading or downgrading an account can be done by reaching out to [email protected] . The tool was developed by Patrick, a product/engineering executive with experience at NASA and Galileo.</p>
