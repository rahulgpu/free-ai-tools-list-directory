            <h2>About 3D textures by Polycam</h2>
            <p>The AI Texture Generator by Polycam is a free tool that allows users to create highly realistic textures for 3D modeling, gaming, and animation using a simple text prompt. By entering a prompt, users can receive up to four seamlessly tileable textures that can be downloaded and used in various software, including Blender, Unreal Engine, SketchUp, Unity, and more. Each generated result can be exported as a texture zip file containing JPEGs for albedo, displacement, normals, and roughness.The tool offers a wide range of applications, including adding detail to 3D objects in video games, AR/VR experiences, 3D digital art, and VFX. Users can also apply the generated textures to their Polycam scans in external 3D applications, allowing for customization and enhancing the appearance of scanned objects.Commercial use of the textures is permitted without restrictions or royalties, and there is no requirement for attribution. The tool comes with a watermark-free and royalty-free commercial license.Polycam welcomes user feedback and continually strives to improve its tools. Users can provide feedback to help enhance the tool's functionality and features. The company values user insights and encourages users to share their thoughts for ongoing improvement.Download links for mobile applications are available on both the App Store and Google Play. Additionally, users can try the tool for free on the web.</p>
