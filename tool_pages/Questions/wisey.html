            <h2>About Wisey</h2>
            <p>Wisey is an AI-powered tool designed specifically for aiding teachers in generating diverse types of questions. The core function of Wisey is to aid the development of high-quality questions that align with curriculum standards, based on any selected topic. It has the capability to generate various types of questions including multiple-choice, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. This utility extends beyond original question creation, as it also allows users to make use of their own resources such as PDFs, word documents, and powerpoints to develop questions. Furthermore, Wisey comes with the additional capability to automatically assign relevant learning objectives to every created question by matching them with the selected standards and curriculum. The standards it presently supports include US state and national standards, UK's KS3, GCSE & A-Level with the feature to support Australian Curriculum and International Baccalaureate arriving soon. After creating these questions, teachers can directly share them with their students through compatible platforms like Google Forms or by developing printable worksheets. Overall, Wisey employs AI to ease the burden of creating diverse and educational standard-aligned questions for teachers.</p>
