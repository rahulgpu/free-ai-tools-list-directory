            <h2>About CallFluent</h2>
            <p>CallFluent AI provides AI-powered voice call solutions to businesses. Its technology emphasizes on transforming phone calls into business opportunities. The tool employs artificial intelligence to automate both inbound and outbound calls, creating a virtual agent that closely mimics human conversation. CallFluent AI claims that a substantial percentage of customers won't realise they're interacting with an automated agent due to the human-like quality of interaction. Aside from English, the AI tool can operate in a variety of languages, making it versatile for global businesses. The AI agent can be tailored to represent the appropriate tone and language that a business desires, fulfilling roles in sales, support or lead engagement. You can customize your AI agent via a no-code agent builder that consists of three steps: creating and configuring your agent, outlining its behavior, and embedding the agent to receive calls and prospects. The tool also offers features like recording calls for review, following a specific conversation script, and providing the AI with information that could be used during phone calls. While CallFluent AI is primarily used for managing phone calls effectively, it also aspires to convert every phone call into a revenue-generating opportunity. Note that it provides early founders discounts and a secure payment process.</p>
