            <h2>About AI Image Detector</h2>
            <p>AI Image Detector is an innovative tool designed to instantly ascertain the origins of an image, allowing users to verify whether an image was generated by artificial intelligence or humans. The tool is primarily used by digital artists, content creators, and legal professionals to validate the authenticity of image content. Users can upload images from various standard file formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP. Once an image is uploaded, the tool begins its analysis process, examining attributes and patterns within the image. The results, indicating the image's likely origin, are provided after the analysis, which usually lasts between a few seconds to a minute. While the tool is highly accurate, it is important to note that no detection method is infallible and accuracy can often depend on an image's complexity and quality. The AI Image Detector is capable of identifying images generated by a range of AI models, but highly sophisticated models might produce harder-to-detect images. The tool is designed for both personal and commercial use and its user-friendly interface offers a streamlined upload and analysis experience. Importantly, the tool prioritizes user privacy and data security, as uploaded images are neither stored nor used for other purposes - they are processed in real-time and promptly deleted post-analysis.</p>
