            <h2>About SupportScribe</h2>
            <p>SupportScribe, developed by Blue Planit LLC, is an AI assistant designed to work alongside Gmail. Its primary goal is to automate the process of responding to customer support tickets. The tool uses ChatGPT technology to draft accurate customer support responses based on the context and properties of business documents, providing an effective way to serve more customers faster. To leverage SupportScribe, users need to upload their business documents such as FAQs, manuals, PDFs, customized reports among others. This uploaded material is used as reference for generating appropriate response. Once the add-on is installed and the needed files are uploaded, users can simply select the customer support email they wish to respond to and have a 'Generate Reply' option within their Gmail interface. In terms of permissions, SupportScribe requires access to manage and send emails when you interact with the add-on, and view your email messages while the add-on is running. The tool is aimed at businesses looking to save time and improve efficiency when tackling their customer support tasks.</p>
