Shepherd supports user interaction through a chatbot with a daily question limit, and provides smart reminders for study sessions. The platform caters to different budget and feature preferences with its Basic and Premium subscription options. The premium version boasts additional features such as ad-free usage, access to session transcripts, unlimited AI-generated flashcards, and increased file upload limits.
