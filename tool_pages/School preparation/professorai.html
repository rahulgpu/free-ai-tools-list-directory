            <h2>About ProfessorAI</h2>
            <p>ProfessorAI is an artificial intelligence course assistant designed to augment education, particularly for Advanced Placement (AP) courses. The tool uses AI tech to mimic a tutor, with a particular focus on servicing advanced course materials. A few noteworthy features it offers include 'AutoGrader' which is used to automatically grade complex question types like LEQs, DBQs, SAQs, MCQs, and FRQs. Students can also directly ask advanced and complicated questions even using equations, diagrams, graphs, or images. The ability to directly access class textbooks is provided to facilitate easy understanding and reference. Uniquely, ProfessorAI can simulate follow-up questions or provide explanations tailored to different understanding levels, mimicking real-world tutoring scenarios. Comprehensive study resources, including quizzes, flashcards, study guides, practice tests are provided along with its AI Quiz and Flashcard Generator for personalized practice. It also offers a 'School Mode' feature designed specifically for teachers, allowing them to retrieve student-specific analytic data, manage access and control options, and receive daily and weekly student summary reports. This advanced AI tool is also capable of providing users with validated external resources for added layers of information. Meanwhile, the VideoGPT feature facilitates learning through full-length videos. An additional tool known as 'AutoGrader' is also available in ProfessorAI, enabling users to receive personalized feedback on their learning.</p>
