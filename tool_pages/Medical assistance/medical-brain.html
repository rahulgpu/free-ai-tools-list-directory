The platform operates by aggregating and analyzing patient data and patient-generated information, including free text from health records, to detect potential health risks and care gaps. This system operates continuously, interpreting data to offer realtime responsive solutions, allowing for immediate patient action to pre-empt evolving health issues.The AI is interactive, engaging with both patients and healthcare providers as necessary to optimize clinical outcomes, divert care away from high-cost settings, and coordinate care efforts. It acts as a decision support platform that helps identify emerging health risks, care gaps, and guides real-time actions that can deter high-cost ER visits. An important feature of Medical Brain is its inclusion of evidence-based best practices in its expansive library of clinical modules. This included guidance from leading medical authorities and the expertise of an in-house team of physicians. The AI system is designed to learn from real-world experiences improving efficiency and intelligence in real-time. The platform offers modules addressing various healthcare domains like orthopedics, lifestyle modifications, radiology, infectious diseases, and renal failure conditions. These modules are targeted at aiding the treatment process, from pre-op medical optimization to post-op recovery phase, providing personalized care that's grounded within evidence-based practices. This results in effective chronic disease management, disease prevention, and quality of life enhancement.</p>
