            <h2>About Dyvo</h2>
            <p>DYVO AI offers two apps for generating stunning product photos and avatars, each with ease and fun. For product photos, all that is needed is to upload one good product photo, and DYVO AI automatically removes the background, sets up the light and colors, and delivers images with different backgrounds that fit your brand style. Users can check out product photos that other users have created and see the results. For avatars, users can upload 14+ photos and generate 100+ avatars in 50+ styles that are created with AI. DYVO AI offers realistic, anime, or art styles suitable for any case, such as social media profiles, gaming, and dating. Users have full commercial copyrights to use the generated photos and avatars as they deem fit. Although pricing may vary by region and local currency, pricing starts from as little as $2.99 for the first set of avatars and $19.99 for 1000 product photos per month. DYVO AI is created by a no-code development studio, Sommo. Users can also access their API, read their terms of use and privacy policy, as well as contact their team through email. Their apps also offer a "Photo guide" that users need to carefully follow to achieve the best results.</p>
