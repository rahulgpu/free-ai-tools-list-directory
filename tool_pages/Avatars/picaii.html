            <h2>About Picaii</h2>
            <p>Picaii is an AI tool that allows users to create realistic digital likeness that can be used for various purposes including personal and commercial use. The tool uses personalized prompts to generate AI images in four categories: beauty, AI robot, fantasy, and cartoon. To get the best results, the tool requires users to upload close-up photos of their models, showing their shoulders, with different facial expressions, in various locations, backgrounds, and angles. Picaii ensures the privacy of users by ensuring that images uploaded are not visible to other users unless they are shared. The images may be stored on a third-party service temporarily, but they are deleted permanently after a certain period. Users have ownership rights to the generated images and can use them as they wish as long as it complies with the platform's terms and conditions. The payment process for the tool is safe, using Stripe as their payment gateway, which ensures that users' payment information is secure and not stored on the platform's servers. Users' photos are stored securely on Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3, which is a reliable and scalable cloud storage service. The tool prohibits the upload of images of minors or children as a violation of their terms and conditions and applicable laws. They have a refund policy in place, but the user must request it before the image generation process has started. Overall, Picaii is a reliable and safe tool for generating digital likenesses through the use of AI technology.</p>
