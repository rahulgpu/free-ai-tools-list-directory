            <h2>About Virtual Face</h2>
            <p>Virtual Face AI is an online platform that utilizes advanced AI algorithms to generate professional-quality headshots. This service begins with users providing their personal photos, upon which the tool creates a range of headshot variations. The AI tool has been tuned and optimized to generate a diverse portfolio of styles, adapting to different scenarios, including 'Suit in the City' and 'Jacket in the Forest'. It affords users the convenience of receiving their AI-generated photos in a short period, without the necessity of a professional photo shoot. For an assurance of quality, the platform provides a money-back guarantee for purchases that meet their quality threshold. AI headshots generated on this platform can be used by users on their professional profiles, including LinkedIn, and on print materials. A commitment to privacy is expressed through the automatic deletion of uploaded images from the platforms servers after a period of seven days. The platform clarifies that user photos are individually used to fine-tune their AI model only for that specific user. Security is a priority as the payment process is facilitated through Stripe, ensuring user financial information stays secure. The tool supports a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, AVIF, and TIFF.</p>
