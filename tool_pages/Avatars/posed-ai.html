            <h2>About Posed AI</h2>
            <p>Posed AI is a tool that allows users to generate personalized AI avatars. It operates by letting users upload photos of their face and upper body from a range of angles and with various expressions. These images are used to train an AI model that can produce an avatar matching the user's features. There is a myriad of avatar styles available, including themes such as Fantasy, Galactic, and Medieval, among others. Once the images have been uploaded, the user's AI is set to train. This training can take up to 90 minutes, after which the generated avatars will be available on the user's dashboard. With a commitment to high quality, Posed AI uses advanced technology to produce images of 400 DPI resolution, suitable for various uses including social media posts, profile pictures and print. As for privacy, the user's photos are deleted immediately after the AI training and the trained model is removed after 15 days. Posed AI accepts various payment methods and ensures secure transactions. Please note that while refunds are available under certain conditions, free trials are not offered due to the computing resources required.</p>
