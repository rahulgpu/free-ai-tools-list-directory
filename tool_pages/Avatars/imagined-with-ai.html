            <h2>About Imagined with AI</h2>
            <p>Imagined with AI is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to generate unique and creative profile images. To start, users must upload between 5 to 10 photos of themselves, a pet, or a loved one, from which the AI will generate new profile images. A variety of poses, facial expressions, and backgrounds are recommended in the uploaded photos to achieve the best results. The uploaded photos are sent to an external training service, and the AI tool then works to generate new and diverse images. Depending upon the queue, the training process may take a few hours on average. Users are notified by mail once their new profile pictures are ready. The images provided cover a range of diverse styles for users to select that best fits their needs. The generated images can be deleted at any time, and the trained model is also available for download for further use with most Stable Diffusion tools. The safety of user's images is ensured as they are deleted post the training process. This tool strives to provide a new and exciting approach to profile picture generation by leveraging the capabilities of AI.</p>
