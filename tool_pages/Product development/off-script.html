            <h2>About Off/Script</h2>
            <p>Off/Script is a community-powered product creation platform designed to bridge the gap between digital creativity and tangible product realization. It is a mobile application that allows users to submit their unique designs or use an AI-powered design studio, then put their creation to a community vote. Upon securing 100 likes, users can launch a campaign for pre-orders. If the pre-order goal is met, the platform facilitates the manufacturing of the product, allowing product creators to retain 70% of the revenue and the intellectual property rights of their designs. The platform also allows users to cast votes on other community members' product concepts that they would like to see realized. This thus provides aspiring creators an avenue to transform their ideas into actual products while retaining a majority stake in their creations. The application is designed to work seamlessly on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices. Continuous improvements are made to enhance the user experience and bug fixes.</p>
