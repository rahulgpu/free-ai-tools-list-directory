            <h2>About Inari</h2>
            <p>Inari is an AI copilot tool designed to assist businesses in various areas such as product, operations, and analytics. It aims to save time by providing a ChatGPT-like assistant that is connected to your applications and tailored to your workflows. One of Inari's key features is its ability to pull in relevant context from your applications and utilize powerful language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 to draft common startup documents and complete operating tasks with high quality and efficiency. It aims to address the challenge faced by operators in startups and tech companies, who spend a significant amount of time searching for information and summarizing it for stakeholders in various communication formats such as status updates, requirement documents, and launch plans.To achieve this, Inari offers a co-pilot app with a design interface for operators to query, analyze, and complete work. It also integrates securely with different work applications, enabling semantic and keyword searches across these apps to provide context. Inari's agents provide workflows for language models to complete user tasks, and it securely connects to work applications like Google Docs and Notion.Additionally, Inari allows users to discover insights by searching for context across different applications, connecting siloed knowledge and making it accessible while completing work. It generates answers and references the sources it retrieves from, enabling users to draft weekly business reviews, search for data across applications using natural language, and ground the responses based on internal knowledge.Inari also offers a feature called agents, which are pre-defined workflows or templates that improve the quality of responses from language models and save time on tasks. Users can also create their own agents, refine prompts, and share them with their team.</p>
