            <h2>About TicketGenius</h2>
            <p>TicketGenius is an AI assistant tool designed to simplify the process of ticket creation on Jira projects. Developed by TaskTuna, this tool generates well-formatted user stories based on brief descriptions and can split existing stories into manageable chunks. With TicketGenius, users can add a description for their task and click submit to generate a ticket with optional subtasks, reducing the manual effort needed to create Jira tickets. Furthermore, the tool can automatically create subtasks for new stories and can link and attach existing ones to their relevant epics. The tool uses artificial intelligence to generate accurate descriptions and undertake some of the ticketing work, reducing the time needed to navigate the project and collaborate with other team members. Users can also expect additional features to be added to the tool as TaskTuna continuously updates it. Regarding privacy, Atlassian's privacy policy is not applicable to the use of this app, and users are referred to TaskTuna's privacy policy. TicketGenius integrates with Atlassian products and enables the creation and editing of issues in Jira, allowing users to view issue properties, read Jira project and issue data, search for issues, and view profile details. However, this app is not part of the Marketplace Bug Bounty program and the partner has not completed the Security Self-Assessment Program. In summary, TicketGenius offers a useful AI-powered solution for Jira ticket generation that simplifies workflow, offers additional features, and enhances productivity.</p>
