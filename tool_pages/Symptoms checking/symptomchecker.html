            <h2>About Symptomchecker</h2>
            <p>SymptomChecker.io is an AI-powered tool designed to evaluate user-reported medical symptoms and provide insight into health concerns. The tool encourages users to describe their symptoms in their own words, inputting details of their onset, severity, progression, influencing factors, and any recently experienced illnesses or travel history. The tool also takes into account a user's existing health issues, surgeries, social history, current or recently used medications, and relevant test results. Its AI system then generates a response based on this user-supplied information. However, it's important to note that the purpose of SymptomChecker.io is not to give medical advice or replace professional medical consultations. Users are advised not to use the feedback from this tool as a substitute for professional medical advice or treatment, nor to ignore or delay seeking professional medical advice based on the generated responses. It's also emphasised that in urgent or emergency situations, it's crucial to contact a healthcare professional or an emergency service right away. SymptomChecker.io should only serve as a preliminary tool to help users better understand their symptoms and it highlights the potential of AI in healthcare.</p>
