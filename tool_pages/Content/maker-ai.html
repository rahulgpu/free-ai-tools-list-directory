            <h2>About Maker AI</h2>
            <p>Maker is an AI-powered creation and editing tool that specializes in video and image generation. It aims to function as an entire production studio at the fingertips of its users. Its core capabilities are tailored towards generating content for brand promotion, including product images, branding kits, and advertising videos. The tool's proprietary artificial intelligence software has been designed to provide creative teams with unique capabilities in content creation. Maker can be used to create enhanced photos and videos suitable for a range of products, in what the creators describe as a 'cinematic' style. It also offers features such as an AI-powered background image generator and a 'Magic Wand' tool for image editing. Users can also animate images into product and lifestyle videos. The tool includes features for automatic layer-based image and video editing, and it offers functionality for swapping clothes, fashion accessories, and models in images. The platform has been created by MoonValley, a research company of scientists and artists.</p>
