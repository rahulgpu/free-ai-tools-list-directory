            <h2>About BrainSoup</h2>
            <p>BrainSoup is an AI tool that introduces the concept of custom AI agents that can handle tasks and automate processes using natural language instructions. It allows users to enhance the abilities of AI with their data while optimizing for privacy and security. Every agent is built to cater to a specific need and is capable of solo tasking, as well as collaborating with other agents for multi-agent projects. BrainSoup's agents utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and MISTRAL AI. Furthermore, the tool employs Semantic Kernel technology, improving the AI's capabilities while imparting a 'sense of time and self' to the agents, thereby ensuring a more personalized user experience. In BrainSoup, users can determine the knowledge boundaries for the AI, using their documents to provide valuable guidance or allowing conversations with the agents to organically expand their knowledge base. An inherent feature of BrainSoup is its powerful data-driven tool that adapts and learns from user interactions. The AI tool prioritizes user data security, minimizing potential data vulnerabilities by using a local database and anonymizing requests made to third-party AI services. BrainSoup also champions flexibility by allowing users to interface with their software environment using simple text files and scripts in any language, empowering users regardless of their coding skill level. Furthermore, the AI agents are equipped with a comprehensive set of built-in tools enabling them to browse the internet, generate images, make API calls, run python scripts, and more. BrainSoup provides a user-friendly interface similar to typical messaging platforms as a native Windows application, contributing to an intuitive AI experience.</p>
