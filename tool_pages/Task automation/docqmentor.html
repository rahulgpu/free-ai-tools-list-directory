DocQmentor enables workflow automation by providing the capability to scan, sort, extract data, run analysis, and store documents consistently.Designed specifically for finance, inventory, HR, and admin departments, DocQmentor maximizes the investments made by enterprises in Microsoft platforms like M365, Power Apps, Dynamics CRM, and Business Central. It leverages the integrations with these platforms to deliver smart automation solutions for various teams.One of the key features of DocQmentor is its ability to automate repetitive tasks within workflows. Users can simply drop their files into the designated DocQmentor folder, and the tool handles the rest. It scans the files, extracts keywords, renames the files, applies metadata, and securely files them in M365. The documents can be easily searched and retrieved in under a second.In terms of security, DocQmentor utilizes the high-end security already built into Microsoft 365, eliminating the need for additional security systems.
