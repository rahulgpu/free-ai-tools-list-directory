As a tool, it ensures prospective customers are engaged and responded to strategically and in a timely manner. Furthermore, the platform includes negotiation skills, industry-specific knowledge, and human-like responses to assist users. Neexa comes with an in-built AI-powered dashboard that allows users to oversee and intervene in chats, update business and product details, and customize the tone and voice of the AI agent. It also provides real-time AI-generated reports and briefs, with the capacity to teach the AI agent about a user's process. Lastly, users have the option of upgrading their package and adding on several features and capabilities.</p>
