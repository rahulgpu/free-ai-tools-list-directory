            <h2>About Llmchess</h2>
            <p>LLMChess is an AI tool that uses GPT models to play chess with users. To operate, users need to select the GPT model they have access to with their API key. The game is played with white pieces and starts when the "Start" button changes to "End." If users need to restart the game, they can either reload the browser or use the "End" button. The tool provides logs that appear in the right-hand pane with a black border during the game. According to the creator, LLMChess has been tested in the Google Chrome browser. Max Hager creates LLMChess and provides additional information on how the game functions and how to participate on his website. The game relies on GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models to make intelligent moves. It is unclear how these models were trained and whether they are pre-trained or fine-tuned on chess datasets. There is also no information provided on the accuracy of the models or how difficult they are to beat. Overall, LLMChess is an interesting tool that allows users to play chess against GPT models. However, the lack of information on the training data and model accuracy may make it challenging for potential users to evaluate its performance.</p>
