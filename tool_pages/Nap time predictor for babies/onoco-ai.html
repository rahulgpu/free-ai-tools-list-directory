            <h2>About Onoco AI</h2>
            <p>Onoco AI is a tool that predicts the optimal nap time for babies based on their individual sleep data. Utilizing anonymous sleep history and baby age data collected by users and honed using neural networks, the Optimal Nap Time Predictor offers personalized recommendations for a baby's next optimal nap time. The tool uses physical clues, parental instinct, and detailed sleep data input into the Onoco app to create its predictions. Notification prompts at 10, 15, or 30 minutes before nap time help caregivers stay on schedule and ensure smooth nap transitions. Upon completion of a nap, users can continue to build their child's profile and recommendations within the app.The Onoco AI approach is designed to provide a more individualized approach to scheduling and tracking baby naps. Standard "one-size-fits-all" approaches, such as traditional wake windows, don't consider individual variations in babies' sleep needs and can lead to ineffective sleep schedules for some children. Powered by algorithmic forecasting, Onoco AI aims to help parents gain a deeper understanding of their baby's sleep patterns while supporting healthy sleep habits.The tool is best suited for the first few months of a baby's life, as caregivers are getting to know their child's routines and behaviors. Later, as caregivers feel comfortable with their child's sleep patterns, they can transfer the sleep data into a more routine-led approach within the customizable Onoco planner. Onoco AI supports all caregiving styles, granting users the flexibility to track feeds and nap times however they like.</p>
