            <h2>About Healax</h2>
            <p>Healax is an AI-powered mental health solution designed primarily for university students. It provides a proactive way of preventing, managing, and reducing stress and anxiety in students' everyday lives. Functioning as a bridge between universities and their students, Healax fosters a culture that prioritizes well-being and facilitates effective communication between students, administrators, and mental health service providers. The tool comprises an array of features. A primary feature is an AI-powered test, conceived by a U.S. psychologist, which collects responses from students, analyses the data, and provides actionable advice corresponding to each student's mental health condition. Moreover, it has a Mood Tracker that allows students to record, monitor, and understand their emotional state, revealing patterns and insights that help them understand themselves better. In addition, Healax includes a booking system for sessions with mental health professionals via different communication channels such as video, chat, and voice, striving to create a supportive and engaged community. Furthermore, its mindful resources, such as guided breathing exercises, and tools like GratitudeBox, which allows students to count their blessings and earn rewards, aim to boost overall psychological well-being. Healax is also envisioned as a platform for content sharing, hosting a unique social network for students to discuss and learn about various mental health topics and providing universities with the ability to offer knowledge and tips on mental healthcare through blogs. The platform envisions using tools like MindfulWalk to engage and motivate students. Aiming to improve students' well-being, Healax is positioned as a digital solution that universities can use to assist students in independently managing their mental well-being.</p>
