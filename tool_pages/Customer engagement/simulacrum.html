            <h2>About Simulacrum</h2>
            <p>Simulacrum AI is an AI-powered tool that provides support in customer service, lead generation, and data management. Its notable feature is its Conversational AI that stands in as a chat assistant, designed to imitate human-like interaction for customer inquiries, thereby significantly reducing website support queries. The tool sets up a knowledge base where user interactions are tracked, analysed, and used for improving response accuracy and relevance. Within seconds, various documents types like PDFs, DOCX, or TXT files, or even URL-based content, can be integrated into this knowledge base. To match with the brand identity, users can customize the chat type, color theme, titles, and add their brand's logo. Another feature is its seamless ability for lead generation where Simulacrum AI identifies call to action or user request actions, summarizes those requests, creates leads within the system, and subsequently notifies the admin via email. It also facilitates auto ticket creation, suggesting the creation of a support ticket whenever it's unable to process user inquiries. Simulacrum AI integrates smoothly with other CRM tools, automatically creating or attaching tickets while analysing the conversation for status and ticket priority. It further offers a Help Center feature to address its usage, pricing plans, and other relevant queries. The service also offers a free trial for new users.</p>
