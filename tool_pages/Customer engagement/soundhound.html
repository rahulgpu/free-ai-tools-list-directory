            <h2>About SoundHound</h2>
            <p>SoundHound offers voice AI interfaces for various platforms including hardware devices, services, vehicles, and mobile apps. Their conversational intelligence solutions rest on their independent voice AI platform which is built to facilitate more natural conversations. The end-to-end tech stack includes features like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Intelligent Transcription, and Text-to-Speech (TTS). The ASR uses both acoustic and language models to deliver increased accuracy, while the NLU enables conversion of speech to meaning swiftly, and Intelligent Transcription provides real-time transcription that interprets meaning through intent and context. The TTS offers a unique voice to enhance brand experiences. SoundHound's platform also accommodates multiple languages and supports both Edge and Cloud connectivity solutions. It also has an Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) feature that can accurately scan and report copyrighted material. Further, SoundHound offers solutions catered to different industry needs such as automotive, hospitality, restaurants, among others, providing hands-free access to increase retention and engagement. Developers have the opportunity to build their voice assistant on the Houndify Developer Platform.</p>
