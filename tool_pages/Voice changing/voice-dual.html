            <h2>About Voice Dual</h2>
            <p>Voice Dual is an AI-driven tool designed to transform user's voice in a variety of languages. This tool works by a user uploading a video, ideally with a maximum duration of 30 seconds. Upon upload, the video is processed on the server, where the AI modifies the audio according to the user's preference. These modifications could include changes in language, tone, or other audio aspects. One of the significant advantages of Voice Dual is its support for over 30 languages, a feature that makes it applicable for a global audience. Thus, it can be used for various reasons, including language learning, entertainment, or digital content creation.However, users should be aware that their uploaded video is stored on the server for processing for 24 hours and then deleted. If users want to preserve the output video, they should save it to their device. Additionally, care should be taken to comply with the laws of their country, and the tool should not be used for illegal purposes or the creation of fake news.For users preferring an unwatermarked version of their video, a full paid version is available for purchase. This version sends a download link to the user's email after purchase. It's important to note that due to the nature of the digital content, purchases are non-refundable.In summary, Voice Dual is an AI tool that allows users to experience transformations of their voice in an array of languages using their uploaded videos.</p>
