            <h2>About Brance</h2>
            <p>Brance is an AI-based tool designed specifically for inside sales teams. It uses GPT technology, finely-tuned Language Models (LLMs), and sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) chatbots to enhance customer interactions and improve sales conversions. Brance's primary aim is to aid sales teams in identifying less promising leads, therefore allowing them to concentrate their efforts on high-quality prospects. Three versions of the product are offered: ChatEngage, ChatSell, and ChatSupport. ChatEngage increases lead capture through intelligent conversation prompts, while ChatSell enables direct engagement with leads via WhatsApp, carrying out targeted 'Intent conversations', and providing personalized follow-ups and recommendations. ChatSupport is designed to resolve user queries and amass feedback at a large scale. Brance also tackles common sales pain points such as lost leads, cold leads, lack of mobile-friendly tools, and time-consuming follow-ups. It integrates with various platforms including WhatsApp, Google Business Manager, Instagram, Web Chat, and Facebook Messenger to streamline sales and customer support processes by leveraging popular digital channels. Backed by technology-savvy investors, Brance empowers businesses to optimize their sales process through an AI-driven experience.</p>
