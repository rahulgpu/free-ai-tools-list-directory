            <h2>About Aladdin AI</h2>
            <p>Aladdin AI is a digital tool designed to serve as a real-time support system for account executives and solution engineers during discovery calls and sales pitches. Its primary function is to accelerate the onboarding process for sales teams, reducing time from months to days. Aladdin AI can be integrated into popular communication platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. During calls, Aladdin AI, also referred to as the 'genie bot', provides instant in-call responses to product-related queries raised by prospects. Users can upload their product documents and FAQs into Aladdins system via seamless integration with tools like Confluence, Jira, and Slack or directly through Aladdins web interface. This feature helps to reduce the risks of underselling a product and improves communication between the solution engineer and the prospect. In addition to this, Aladdin AI stores call transcripts and dialogue Q&As that serve to continuously enrich its AI engine. This ensures updated product knowledge accessibility during calls, reducing the necessity of substantial back and forth communication within the sales team. The overall effect is a notable increase in sales process efficiency.</p>
