            <h2>About Openkoda</h2>
            <p>Openkoda is an AI-powered open-source platform designed for efficient business application development. The platform offers pre-built application templates that aid in the streamlining of development cycles, enabling users to focus on unique functionality rather than building from scratch. These customizable templates are suitable for a range of applications, including but not limited to, insurance policy management and time tracking software. Furthermore, the platform is designed to avoid vendor-lock in, providing developers with full ownership of their code, allowing for considerable flexibility and control. Openkoda also lays the groundwork for quick development of Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), offering pre-established core functionalities that can be easily customized to meet specific business needs. The platform also lends itself for application modernization, effectively helping organizations update, migrate, or re-platform their legacy systems. As an added advantage, Openkoda employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) which extends its business logic and user interface capabilities. As a scalable and secure platform, it provides multi-tenancy options and continuous OWASP security scans, ensuring a reliable solution for application development.</p>
