            <h2>About CloudflareAI</h2>
            <p>Cloudflare + AI is a tool that allows users to run fast, low-latency inference tasks on pre-trained machine learning models natively on Cloudflare Workers. It provides the ability to build and deploy ambitious AI applications on Cloudflare's global network, which offers global availability and scalability. The tool includes full-stack AI building blocks such as serverless AI on GPUs, a variety of popular models to choose from, and the ability to run AI models from Workers, Pages, or anywhere via their REST API. Additionally, Cloudflare + AI offers features to enhance reliability and scalability, including caching, rate limiting, and analytics through their AI Gateway. It also provides the capability to generate and store embeddings in a globally distributed vector database with Vectorize, enabling efficient search on top of user data for repeated use with machine learning models. The tool emphasizes ease of use and quick deployment, with the option to choose templates from a curated catalog of off-the-shelf models. It supports tasks such as image classification, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, text generation, and translation. Users can utilize Workers AI and Vectorize to run AI inference tasks on Pages, favorite frameworks, or any stack via an API with just a few lines of code.Cloudflare + AI is trusted by well-known AI companies such as Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft, Hugging Face, and Databricks. It aims to help users build reliable, secure, and cost-effective AI architectures while avoiding surprise bills. The tool also offers cost-effective storage for training models and AI-generated assets with R2, which enables affordable multi-cloud architectures for training large language models.</p>
