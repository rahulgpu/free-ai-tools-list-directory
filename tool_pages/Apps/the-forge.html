            <h2>About The Forge</h2>
            <p>The Forge is an AI platform that facilitates building, sharing, and monetizing various AI-powered applications. Users can create their own projects by selecting their preferred AI models and templates or starting from scratch. The platform enables versioning to easily go back to previous drafts and presentation of both web applications and APIs for integration into existing products. Additionally, it supports one-click integrations (limited beta) with various applications like WordPress and React. The Forge marketplace allows users to sell or buy applications with predefined sales packages, which can be connected with their Stripe account. However, custom payment handling is only available in the limited beta. Users can test out pre-built applications and share their creations with the community and friends through a simple link. The platform's editor allows users to preview their progress and output as they develop their applications. The Forge is designed to appeal to a wide range of users, including individuals who want to build AI applications for personal use and developers who aim to develop AI-based applications for monetization or integration into existing products. The platform's features are designed to enable even those without coding experience to design AI-powered applications within a few minutes. The community aspect of the Forge is also a benefit for users looking for inspiration and support as they develop their applications.</p>
