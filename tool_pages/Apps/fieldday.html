            <h2>About FieldDay</h2>
            <p>FieldDay is an AI tool that enables anyone to create custom vision AI applications. With the camera as a platform for productivity, users can collect a dataset specific to their expertise and refine the algorithm through iterations. It provides a mobile machine learning toolkit, allowing users to develop and embed custom AI apps into their preferred tools using only their smartphones.FieldDay empowers users to bring utility to their cameras by teaching their apps to "see." By gathering samples of what they want their AI to detect, they can easily create custom AI models with a simple tap of a button, requiring just a few minutes. Users can test the accuracy of their AI in real-time by visualizing the results.One of the key features of FieldDay is the ability to train models to identify multiple objects within a scene. This tool also offers functionality to label, manage, and push different model iterations. It aims to simplify the process of building custom AI models, allowing users to get started quickly.FieldDay has recently released its initial version for iOS and is available for download on the App Store. It provides valuable resources such as a comprehensive guide on how it works, pricing details, a legal section, and a community to collaborate and learn from other users.</p>
