            <h2>About Graphlit</h2>
            <p>Graphlit is an API-first platform designed for developers who are building AI-powered applications with unstructured data. It caters to various vertical markets, including legal, sales, entertainment, healthcare, and engineering. The platform offers a serverless, cloud-native infrastructure and automates complex data workflows. It allows developers to easily handle data ingestion, knowledge extraction, LLM conversations, semantic search, alerting, and webhook integrations. One of the key features of Graphlit is its ability to extract knowledge from any unstructured data source. It can process various types of content, such as PDFs, web pages, images, RSS feeds, podcasts, Notion pages, YouTube videos, and Slack messages. With Graphlit, developers can build conversational knowledge graphs using Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The platform utilizes the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern and Schema.org's entity data model to transform complex data into searchable, contextualized knowledge graphs. Additionally, Graphlit provides a multimedia content management platform that supports secure storage of content in various formats, including documents, audio and video files, and complex data formats like CAD drawings and geospatial data. It also offers powerful vector-based knowledge retrieval and media processing workflows for image thumbnails and previews. The platform is production-ready and offers granular usage tracking to help developers understand and manage their costs. It encrypts content storage and supports API access with role-based access control (RBAC) for enhanced security. Graphlit is developer-focused and offers a free tier to get started. Pricing for paid tiers is based on the amount of content ingested into the platform.</p>
