            <h2>About BuilderKit</h2>
            <p>BuilderKit is a highly modular NextJS AI Boilerplate designed to facilitate the development and deployment of AI applications within a short time frame. The tool has robust support for all major AI Models and Workflows. It includes comprehensive NextJS boilerplates, various AI modules, and key integrations for functionality such as authentication, payments, emails, and customer support. Several AI apps are pre-built and integrated into BuilderKit, streamlining the development process for users. The tool also allows developers to harness the OpenAI functionality and integrate it with their own AI Apps. Features include creating a ChatGPT clone, using the streaming API for quick response times, integrating with web-browsing, history, DALL-E and custom plugins. It also offers several additional features, such as fallback models to avoid 'model-overloaded' responses and advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Pinecone. Other core features include automatic image uploading, chat history, sharing capability, rate-limits, and detailed usage monitoring for fine-tuned control. Notably, BuilderKit includes demo applications such as a ChatGPT clone with built-in web crawling and DALL-E image generation capabilities, as well as a PDF chat for uploading PDFs to ask questions, get summaries, or seek information.</p>
