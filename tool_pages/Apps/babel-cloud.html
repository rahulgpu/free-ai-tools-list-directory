            <h2>About Babel Cloud</h2>
            <p>Babel Cloud is a Cloud Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed to assist both humans and AI in building AI applications. It leverages AI to streamline the development process with its capabilities such as coding, debugging, and monitoring. An intrinsic feature of Babel Cloud is its AI-assisted development lifecycle enhancing efficiency throughout the process of creating applications.The platform presents a business-oriented architecture, providing intuitive and user-friendly setup ensuring a clear understanding of the system, hence results in efficiency enhancement. Babel Cloud allows developers to visualize the overall architecture of their system, bringing about a 'what you see is what you get' experience.A core feature of Babel Cloud is its built-in AI elements, facilitating ease in the evaluation of prompts, building embeddings, or calling Language Models(LM). This native support for AI capabilities in the IDE simplifies incorporating AI features into applications.Moreover, Babel Cloud offers a unique feature termed as 'Holographic Observation'. This feature enables developers to observe the execution details directly in the code, this can be considered as an 'x-ray' for your application. Developers can, at any point in time, observe and understand the functioning of the application.Lastly, Babel Cloud is in active search for experts in areas such as LLM, K8s, Knative, Spring, webflux, Rust, Kotlin, TypeScript, and Next.js. They offer positions for AI Experts, Cloud Native Experts, and UI Designers, showcasing their commitment to continually advancing their platform.</p>
