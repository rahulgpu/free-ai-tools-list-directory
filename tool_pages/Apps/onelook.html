            <h2>About Onelook</h2>
            <p>Onelook is an AI tool designed to simplify the process of building applications by allowing users to describe the application in human language. Rather than the traditional code-writing approach, you interact with the AI in a natural conversation. A key feature of this tool is that it generates both back-office views for administrators and non-admin views, catering to different levels of users. As the AI generates your application, you can review and refine it by providing more instructions.Moreover, Onelook comes equipped with built-in analytics, providing insights into your application data. This makes it capable of visualizing application-specific metrics and analytics, a feature that might be crucial for understanding user behavior and app performance.User Guides are automatically created for your applications, a feature designed to help your users navigate and understand the functionalities more easily. As an integral part of creating the application, the tool generates these guides, reducing the additional labour of manual instruction creation.Onelook is designed with a human-first approach. Whenever there are ambiguities, the AI asks for clarifications, ensuring the conversation remains natural and intuitive. The tool's design principles emphasize guiding the conversation, gradually falling into the development process by asking for details as the conversation goes.Lastly, Onelook has a feature where it explains how to use certain features in plain English. If you're unsure about anything, you can ask the AI to clarify. This establishes Onelook not only as a tool for building applications but also as a learning resource.</p>
