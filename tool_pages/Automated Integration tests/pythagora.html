            <h2>About Pythagora</h2>
            <p>Pythagora is a development tool known for simplifying the process of application development. Its primary function is to enable the construction of apps from scratch, through an interactive approach that involves dialogues with users. This tool works in conjunction with the user, breaking down application specifications on a document, and actively partaking in project architecture, definition of requirements, selection of technologies, backend architecture and more. Working on a feature-to-feature basis, Pythagora writes code for each task, implements the code, and reviews it, assuring code quality. With its troubleshooter agent, it understands problematic scenarios and works towards rectification. Pythagora is designed to test applications, and seeks user feedback for the test results. It's a Visual Studio (VS) Code extension, powered by Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) Pilot, identified as a powerful code generation tool. Pythagora is capable of reading the terminal to catch errors, identifying bugs, proposing and implementing solutions, and fixing its own code if necessary. It uses version control, tracking the entire codebase effectively with git. Upcoming features include cloud deployment of applications and automated testing. Furthermore, it has a straightforward operational mechanism, only requiring users to carry out conversations with it, making it user-friendly and efficient.</p>
