            <h2>About Codecademy AI Learning Tools</h2>
            <p>The AI Learning Tools from Codecademy promise a new approach to interactive tech learning. Central to this is the use of artificial intelligence to streamline the learning process. Codecademy's new AI-assisted features include providing context to pieces of code, explaining errors, and offering project hints to learners. They can be used across the learning catalog, encompassing areas like data science and coding basics as well as on popular courses. The tools also facilitate the development of AI skills through hands-on exercises such as writing, testing, and refining generative AI prompts. The mobile upgrades, including an integrated development environment (IDE), allow learners to code on any device. Coursework progress can be continued whenever and wherever best suits the learner. Additional features include integrated tooltip documents that provide quick explanations of terms and concepts, and assist in decoding new concepts without leaving the learning environment. Other notable inclusions are built-in professional tools for data science work such as Jupyter Notebook, instant AI feedback on free response questions, and autocomplete functions for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages that ease the learning of their syntax. These tools collectively aim to provide a more insightful, efficient, and flexible learning experience.</p>
