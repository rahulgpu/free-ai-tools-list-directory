By using natural language prompts, users can harness the app's AI-powered stack creation capabilities. The technology, powered by GPT4, allows users to prompt and edit their stacks until they get a result that suits their requirements.Daystack is a multi-platform app available on Android, iPhone, and the web, providing flexibility in how users access and utilize it. It also offers location-enabled functionality, allowing users to search for locations and add them to their stacks. Additionally, the app supports media integration, enabling users to link and play YouTube videos directly within their stacks.With the option to join a waitlist for its upcoming release on Android, iPhone, and web platforms, Daystack aims to revolutionize how individuals organize their daily activities in a personalized and efficient manner.</p>
