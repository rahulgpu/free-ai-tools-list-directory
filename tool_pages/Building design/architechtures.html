            <h2>About ARCHITEChTURES</h2>
            <p>ARCHITEChTURES is an AI-powered platform designed specifically for the residential sector that enables efficient and optimized building design. The tool dramatically reduces the design time, thereby improving decision-making processes. The tool is used by architects and real estate developers to fast-track feasibility analysis processes, with a focus on regulatory confidence, rapid iterations, and instant insights. Users have the ability to download the original BIM model of the site for seamless integration into classic workflows. ARCHITEChTURES features a proprietary generative AI technology that fetches real-time solutions for each user iteration, effectively satisfying the geometry, objectives, and design criteria entered by the user. This positions the designer at the helm of decision-making control, allowing them to focus on the quantitative aspects of the design. The advantage of such a system lies in the opportunity for repetitive adaptation of the design to achieve complete satisfaction of the user. The real-time BIM solution and project data are available to view and to be downloaded in formats like XLSX, DXF, or IFC. The platform is designed to offer optimal solutions in real time, meeting quantitative requirements and facilitating the provision of maximum architectural value to the project. Upcoming features include extensive simulation for detailed knowledge of passive behaviour throughout a year, collaboration features for team-based projects, and sharing options for easy collaboration.</p>
