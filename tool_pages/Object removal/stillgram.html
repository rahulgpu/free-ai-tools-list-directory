            <h2>About Stillgram</h2>
            <p>Stillgram is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven camera app designed specifically for iPhone users. The distinctive feature of Stillgram is its ability to intelligently subtract background crowds from photographs taken in urban or travel environments, allowing for clean shots of desired subjects without unnecessary distractions. It essentially provides the ability to capture photos of popular tourist destinations as if they were virtually empty. This is achieved with AI algorithms running offline on the phone, thereby saving mobile data and avoiding potential roaming charges. The application offers a Pro version, with additional features such as the ability to handpick individuals who stay in the photo and advanced resolution options. Stillgram also offers a novelty feature named 'LIVE STILLGRAMS', short videos that start with a crowded scene and then transition into a photo with the crowd removed. The app is lauded for being ultra-fast due to it being optimized for iPhones Neural Engine. Another significant aspect is that it offers guidance and Protips for users to enhance their photo capturing experiences. This includes advice on crowd management in shots and best practices for achieving the optimal photo. Free with the option of upgrading to PRO for more features, Stillgram provides an innovatively engineered solution for travel photographers striving for crowd-free images.</p>
