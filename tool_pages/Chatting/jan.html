            <h2>About Jan</h2>
            <p>Jan is an open-source alternative to ChatGPT designed to operate completely offline on your device. This AI tool prioritizes privacy and is designed around high customizability. Since it runs offline, all conversations, preferences, and model usage stay securely on your computer. These are fully exportable and can be deleted at any time, asserting the user's control over data. It is unique in providing an OpenAI-equivalent API server at LOCALHOST: 1337 that can be utilized as a drop-in replacement with compatible applications, easing the integration of AI into your workflow. A noteworthy feature of Jan is its capacity to increase productivity via customizable AI assistants and global hotkeys. Currently, it is in the development stage; hence, bugs may be expected as the product evolves. However, its core team is driven by the belief that AI should be open source, which is reflected in their public development approach. Given its early stage, future updates are expected to further enhance Jan's functionality and usability, as part of a continuous process for improvement. Please note that a mobile app version for Jan is under development. Potential users are encouraged to follow the progress on their public roadmap and GitHub page for the latest updates.</p>
