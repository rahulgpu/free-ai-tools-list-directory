            <h2>About Cyphertech</h2>
            <p>AskCyph™ LITE is a lightweight AI chatbot developed by Cypher Tech Inc. that allows users to run an AI model directly in their web browser. With a focus on privacy and security, AskCyph™ LITE enables users to access AI capabilities without the need for sending data over the internet. By running the AI model locally on the user's device, AskCyph™ LITE ensures that questions and queries remain private.Currently in the experimental stage, AskCyph™ LITE may occasionally generate incorrect responses, but the development team is actively working towards improvements. The tool offers two Lite Models: BASIC and ADVANCED, each with its own system requirements. The BASIC MODEL requires a minimum of 4GB of free RAM, while the ADVANCED MODEL requires a minimum of 8GB of free RAM and covers a wider range of knowledge domains.As AskCyph™ LITE operates locally, moderation is limited to the client side, giving users control over the level of moderation. It is important to note that the information provided by AskCyph™ LITE is for general informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as legal, financial, or professional advice. While efforts are made to provide accurate and up-to-date information, the tool does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the provided information.By using AskCyph™ LITE and completing the necessary security measures, users acknowledge and agree that they are responsible for any actions taken based on the information provided and that Cypher Tech Inc. will not be liable for any damages or losses arising from the use of the tool.</p>
