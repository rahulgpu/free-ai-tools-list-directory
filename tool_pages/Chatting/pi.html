            <h2>About Pi</h2>
            <p>Pi is a personal AI tool that aims to provide support and conversation to users. It is claimed to be smart and always available for users to ask questions or seek advice on various topics. The tool appears to be designed primarily for personal use, offering a platform for users to converse with an AI in a way that resembles a human conversation. It is not clear whether Pi is based on pre-defined responses or uses natural language processing to adapt to the user's input. The tool seems to be a virtual assistant that focuses on providing an emotional connection for users seeking support. It is possible that the tool may incorporate machine learning algorithms to understand the user's preferences and cater to their individual needs over time. The primary aim of the tool seems to be providing emotional support and answering questions rather than specific tasks like scheduling or automation. Overall, the Pi tool is positioned as a companion to provide users with a listening ear and a sounding board for their thoughts and emotions. The tool seems to be aimed at individuals who require emotional support or a listening ear, rather than businesses looking for automation.</p>
