            <p>04-x is a privacy-focused chat platform that is primarily designed for interacting with Language Learning Models (LLMs). Its standout feature is its dedicated user privacy, with user data kept securely and solely accessible to the individual user.

The platform supports a broad range of models including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and DALLE 3 by OpenAI, Claude 2 and Claude Instant by Anthropic, and various offerings from Cohere, to name a few. It also supports an assortment of open-source models capable of running locally using Ollama. Users can effortlessly conduct various tasks such as generating language-based outputs, summarizing texts, and interacting in a conversational manner with these AI models. The platform features an intuitive interface that allows seamless navigation and operation. Users can choose to log in using their email or Google account. While the listing is quite exhaustive, potential users can expect new models to be included since the platform is continuously updated to broaden its scope.</p>
