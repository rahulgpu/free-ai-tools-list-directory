            <h2>About Convai</h2>
            <p>Convai is a conversational AI-based service that allows developers to bring characters to life in virtual worlds, games, metaverse, and other applications. The tool works by enabling a character with human-like conversation capabilities and connecting it to NPC assets inside game engines. Convai features an easy-to-use interface that allows developers to create a character's intelligence and plugins to connect it to character assets and worlds. The tool offers a range of features such as open-ended, voice-based conversations, adding unlimited knowledge to make a character an expert, and scene perception and actions. Convai addresses the problem of hallucination of information that occurs with large language models by adding a knowledge base for characters, which can help ensure accurate responses to user queries. Convai finds extensive use in gaming, learning, and entertainment with AI characters. In gaming, developers can use Convai to enable NPCs with open-ended conversation capabilities, onboard users with conversational characters, and enable companion bots with intelligence to carry out commands and strategies. In learning and socializing, Convai can be used to build AI tutors in XR that can teach any subject with reliable expertise, enable AI-guided training applications in various domains such as healthcare, legal, manufacturing, eCommerce, and populate worlds with AI assistants that can help visitors and make the world seem alive.Convai supports integrations with a range of platforms, including Unreal Engine, Unity, Nvidia Omniverse, Discord, and Roblox. The tool offers documentation, a blog, FAQs, and a support center. Convai is useful for developers building the next generation of games and experiences.</p>
