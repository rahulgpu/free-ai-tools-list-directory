            <h2>About GitHub Data Explorer</h2>
            <p>GitHub Data Explorer is an AI-powered tool designed to simplify the process of extracting insights from GitHub event data. The user can input a question in natural language, and the Data Explorer will generate an SQL query based on that question, and then return the results in a visual format. The tool uses the capabilities of Text2SQL integrated into Chat2Query, making it an effective solution for exploring any dataset. The data used in GitHub Data Explorer is sourced from GH Archive, a project that archives all GitHub event data since 2011. However, the tool has certain limitations. Its efficiency in generating SQL queries for large and complex requests can be compromised, and there might be occasional service instability. To ensure effective results, users are advised to utilize clear, specific phrases in their questions. The tool also has certain limitations with the scope of data it can explore, as the data sourced is strictly from GH Archive. In case of unsatisfactory results or query generation failures, users are encouraged to refine their queries or check the network and request limits. The tool also offers question optimization tips and query templates near the search box for users' convenience. GitHub Data Explorer relies on a number of technologies including the GH Archive and GitHub event API for data sourcing, and the TiDB Cloud for handling large-volume data. Translation of natural language to SQL is facilitated by the OpenAI engine. Continual improvements and optimizations are being worked on to enhance the tool's potential and performance.</p>
