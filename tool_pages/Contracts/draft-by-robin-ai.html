            <h2>About Draft by Robin AI</h2>
            <p>Contract Drafting with Robin AI is a tool that simplifies the process of creating contracts. It allows commercial teams to create contracts in minutes from pre-approved templates, while the legal team maintains control and oversight through built-in approval workflows. This tool uses approved templates from the legal team, ensuring consistent and compliant language every time. Dynamic templates are linked to forms that automatically populate the correct terms as users fill in the details. The approval workflows help commercial teams initiate contracts quickly, while the legal team stays in control. Robin AI's contract drafting tool reduces the workload of legal teams so that they can focus on high-value work. The tool is built with both lawyers and non-lawyers in mind, and depending on the complexity of contract templates, access can be provided to legal and commercial teams. Robin AI uses generative AI models overlaid with human review to create templates for several common contract types. Clients who upgrade to the full Draft module can configure their own templates in the tool, with the support of Robin AI's in-house team of lawyers and paralegals. Robin AI's contract drafting tool is free to use, and anyone can access helpful templates on it to generate common agreements like NDAs, employment contracts, services agreements, and supply agreements. Robin AI offers a simple, transparent pricing model for their Draft and Robin Suite modules. Overall, Robin AI's contract drafting tool simplifies the way contracts are created, giving users more control and oversight, reducing legal teams' workload, and ensuring consistent and compliant language in all contracts.</p>
