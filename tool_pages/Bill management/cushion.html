            <h2>About Cushion</h2>
            <p>Cushion is an AI-enhanced app designed to assist in managing, paying, and creating credit through your bills and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) plans. It connects securely to your accounts and organizes your payments, giving an overview of what you have paid and what is due next, facilitating better budget management. It offers a novel approach to building credit history by transforming BNPL payments and ordinary bill payments into credit building opportunities. The tool allows you to make payments using a virtual Cushion card and automatically logs your payments for credit report purposes. A feature for tracking credit scores and splitting bills with roommates or partners is proposed for future updates. The app also features utmost security, utilizing 256-bit SSL encryption and top-tier security partnerships. It provides a calendar view that allows you to easily track your upcoming payments. Cushion also comes with two virtual card options that can be set as your primary payment method with regular billers. Payments made with the Cushion card are automatically reported to the credit bureaus to assist in building credit.</p>
