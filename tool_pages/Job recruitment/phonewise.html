            <h2>About Phonewise</h2>
            <p>Phonewise is an AI tool designed to streamline phone-related recruitment services. The platform focuses on aligning expectations of hiring managers and candidates through various integrated services. Phonewise's primary offering involves specifically organizing and facilitating the screen call interactions between job description requirements and candidate resumes, allowing a smoother and more efficient recruitment process.Phonewise allows stakeholders such as hiring managers and HR heads to discuss all necessary information about the role and the candidate, with the convenience of converting these conversations into a comprehensive job description. Further, it offers functionality to aid recruiters in handling poorly formatted candidate CVs, allowing for the upload of any given CV and converting it into an organized and easily editable format.A notable functionality of Phonewise is the automatic gathering and updating of information from conversations with candidates, including updating candidate's resumes and profiles directly from the platform. These updated and enriched details can then be exported to an Applicant Tracking System or PDF file, presenting a complete overview of candidate proficiency in line with the job description.Phonewise is particularly useful in focusing on relevant information while reducing time spent on administrative tasks like manual note-taking. It does this by providing high-quality transcripts and extracting vital information about candidates during screen-call conversations. This process makes it notably accessible for recruiting agencies, individual headhunters, consultancy companies, HR managers, and entrepreneurs, who can benefit from the automated candidate detail capture, thereby making the recruitment process more efficient and accurate.</p>
