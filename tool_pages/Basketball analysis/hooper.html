            <h2>About Hooper</h2>
            <p>Hooper is an artificial intelligence tool designed to assist basketball players in assessing and improving their performance. Users are able to record their games or solo shootarounds using a phone, and the application processes the footage, tracking statistics and creating highlight clips. The tool is adaptable to various game formats such as 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5.Hooper's AI function utilizes 'Mixtapes' to review each shot and predict automatically generated highlights. The application monitors the players game stats, allowing users to compare their progress with others. Users can also save and track their performance over time, a feature useful for monitoring progress and improvement.Not limited to solo practice sessions, Hooper is built for real games, accommodating everyday pickup games to tournament playoffs. Furthermore, it offers a unique feature of a 2-hour game which can be watched efficiently in just 15 minutes with unnecessary time removed automatically and the ability to skip to the best plays.The tool requires only a phone for set-up and running. Once the action is recorded, the feature to edit your game is provided in the application. Ideally set-up at a height of at least 5 feet, it can also support a 'ground mode' at the expense of certain features like shot chart and distinctions between 2 pointer and 3 pointer.Hooper also provides the capability to track full-court games by using two phones to record each half of the court. This requires two different Hooper accounts to record each half and then linking the two sessions together into a single full-court session.Its functionality has been reviewed positively by users, praising its abilities to track shots, analyze games, and generate game highlights, which can even be shared with friends. Its intuitive design allows the players to focus on the game, while Hooper does the tracking and generating of clips. As a final note, the degree of tracking accuracy reported by Hooper is reliant on a recommended set-up, although constant improvements are being made to get close to professional analytics.</p>
