            <h2>About Tryellie</h2>
            <p>Ellie is an AI email assistant designed to respond to emails in a user's writing style. It uses AI technology to learn from previously sent emails and crafts intelligent responses matching the user's communication patterns while providing a personal touch to every email. Ellie is capable of understanding context from email threads and uses this skill to generate relevant replies. An important feature is that Ellie can be taught specific information which it can subsequently use in its responses. This tool can be used in multiple languages, offering contextually appropriate replies accordingly. It can also effectively switch roles depending on the context. Ellie is available as a browser extension, meaning it integrates into users existing workflows by working directly within their inboxes. While Ellie currently supports Gmail and Fastmail functionalities, plans to expand compatibility with other web-based email clients are in progress. To help the AI match the users style better, the user can provide Ellie with sample email data. Theres no need to worry about privacy concerns as Ellie only accesses the most recent replies in a thread, doesnt store email data, and never shares or sells user data. Furthermore, Ellie can help overcome reply anxiety and aid those struggling with dyslexia or needing assistance with language and grammar skills.</p>
