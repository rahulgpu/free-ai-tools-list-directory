            <h2>About Eye Shape AI</h2>
            <p>Eye Shape AI is a tool leveraging artificial intelligence for analyzing eye shapes. It utilizes advanced image processing technology and AI algorithms to extract features from an uploaded photo of a user for eye shape classification. It evaluates elements such as size, spacing, and curvature of eyes to accurately determine eye shape. The AI has been trained on a vast dataset, allowing it to recognize a wide range of eye shapes such as almond, round, upturned, downturned, wide-set, and close-set. Its design accounts for the diversity in eye shapes across different individuals, ensuring accurate and reliable analysis. Privacy of the user's pictures is a top priority, with images being used solely for analysis and not stored for other purposes. Currently, the tool is optimized for individual analysis for the highest accuracy. To ensure precise results, users should upload clear, high-quality photos where their eyes are visibly unobstructed and well-lit. The tool is completely free to use, its mission being to provide accessible tools for everyone to better understand their unique features. In case of difficulty recognizing eye shapes, users are advised to submit better-lit and clearer photos or contact the support team. The tool can also help users select eyewear that complements their specific eye shape after analysis.</p>
