            <h2>About MBox AI meet</h2>
            <p>MBox AI meet streamlines your workflow by providing an AI-powered tool that listens to your Google Meets, captures every detail of the discussion, and generates a concise summary of the key points. It then delivers the summary directly to your email. MBox is designed to improve your productivity by handling note-taking so you can focus on participation in your meetings. The tool provides real-time transcriptions, ensuring all details of the meetings are captured, and even identifies speakers. It prioritizes privacy, with no audio or video storage occurring during the Google Meet integration. The summary generated not only includes the key points discussed, but it also captures action items, important topics raised, and decisions made during the meeting. Moreover, MBox AI is constantly learning and improving, which means the accuracy of summaries will become more precise over time. The tool doesn't just provide summaries, it comes with additional AI features that will be continually updated over time. Expected future developments include flagging important moments and the addition of a real-time AI assistant for meetings. Currently, this tool is specifically designed to assist with Google Meet, with potential compatibility with other platforms in the future. For use, the MBox AI meets requires the installation of a Chrome extension. It's important to note that while the pricing model is still under development, there may be a free tier with basic features, and other features may be made available through paid subscriptions.</p>
