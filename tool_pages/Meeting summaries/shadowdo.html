            <h2>About ShadowDo</h2>
            <p>Shadow is an AI tool aimed to streamline your post-meeting work. This tool listens and comprehends conversations, translating them into a variety of actionable tasks that enhances efficiency. It is particularly designed to function without the presence of a bot, thus enabling smooth conversations. An important feature of Shadow is the ability to start listening whenever communication starts, making it a perfect tool for platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc. Once a conversation is concluded, Shadow produces transcripts and summaries with timestamps for future reference. It also helps accomplish different tasks such as writing meeting summaries, updating CRM and more based on the generated transcripts. Shadow safeguards users' privacy by storing all recordings locally on users' devices, which can only be accessed with the user's permission. The tool is also constantly learning to offer more features and skills. Shadow can be extremely valuable in a series of application areas like design feedback, bug reporting, customer support, asynchronous interviews, working across different time zones and sales outreach. For instance, in design feedback scenarios, the tool allows concise feedback collection and simplifies the process of discussing changes. For bug reporting scenarios, it transforms traditional long written reports into more demonstrative reports, making the process efficient and easily understandable. This robust tool hence significantly reduces manual workloads, leaving more time for essential tasks and improving overall workflow while prioritizing user privacy.</p>
