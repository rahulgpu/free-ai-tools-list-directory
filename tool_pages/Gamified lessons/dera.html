            <h2>About Dera</h2>
            <p>Dera is a user-friendly AI tool designed to revolutionize the learning experience by creating gamified, bite-sized lessons. It supports teachers by enabling them to generate quizzes effortlessly without any coding knowledge. Within the lesson creation process, teachers provide the lesson plan and examples, after which the AI completes the task of generating the rest of the content. This process is handled through an intuitive interface, making it easy to modify the AI-generated lessons and tailor them to specific needs. The tool contains a gamification feature, constructing interactive and enjoyable lessons that engage students. To encourage student participation and competition, Dera supports a reward system in which students earn points. Progress and performance can be monitored through analytics and leaderboards. Dera also offers different pricing plans and the services included vary based on the chosen plan. As of now, Dera supports English, Math, Science, and Chinese subjects and is primary and elementary school level oriented in Singapore, the United States, and the United Kingdom. However, the tool can also be calibrated for other levels and countries upon demand. Finally, there is no need for students to create an account to use Dera, lessons can be shared via a link.</p>
