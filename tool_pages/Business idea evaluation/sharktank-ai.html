            <h2>About SharkTank AI</h2>
            <p>SharkTank AI is a unique tool designed to simulate the experience of pitching a business idea. Inspired by the popular TV show, users can pitch their business concept to virtual representations of the show's 'sharks' and potentially get a deal. Upon entering their business idea, the expected investment amount, and the proposed equity offer, the user presses the 'Submit Pitch' button to start the interaction. The AI-based 'sharks' include well-known figures like Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran, Robert Herjavec, Lori Greiner, Daymond John, and Kevin O'Leary, each with their own virtual persona reflecting their real-world focus areas and expertise. The user receives feedback or a deal proposal from these 'sharks', giving them a chance to explore the potential viability and perceived value of their business idea. This tool, created by Yoni Goldshtein, is designed for both entertainment and educational purposes, as it enables users to gauge the attractiveness of their business proposals and practice pitching ideas in a fun and risk-free environment. Lastly, while the tool is AI-based, it's not intended for serious investment analysis but can be a great resource for aspiring entrepreneurs seeking feedback on their startup ideas.</p>
