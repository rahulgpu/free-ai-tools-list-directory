            <h2>About ReadPal</h2>
            <p>ReadPal.ai is an AI assistant designed to enhance an individual's online activities, including online learning, shopping, and research. As a chrome extension, it serves as an adaptive companion that integrates into a user's workflow, without causing any disruption. It provides smart assistance by offering instant explanations, summaries, recommendations, and deeper insights about the content viewed by the user. It enables a streamlined interaction by offering keyboard shortcuts, context menus, and one-click prompts, making AI assistance both accessible and unobtrusive. An important feature of ReadPal.ai is its adaptability; while it currently uses a specific AI model for processing information, it is not restricted to one, with the possibility of using different models for different tasks and potentially training new ones in the future. This tool prioritizes user privacy and does not store any user data beyond sign-in information and usage statisticswith all queries to third-party AI model providers anonymized and chat history stored locally on the user's browser. Although currently only available for Chrome, there is active exploration to widen its compatibility with other platforms.</p>
