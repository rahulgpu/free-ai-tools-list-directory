            <h2>About Jamix</h2>
            <p>Jamix is an artificial intelligence assistant aimed at optimizing work operations and securing company data. Its primary function is to consolidate and search across a company's applications and data files, answering queries in a prompt manner and providing sources for validation of obtained information. This feature alleviates the need to switch between various apps to locate information or files required for tasks.In addition to this, Jamix is designed to automate repetitive tasks and initiate actions within various apps at the user's behest. This can range from filing an issue in a task manager to brainstorming ideas and generating summaries. The systems capabilities also extend to writing content, displaying a functionality similar to AI systems like ChatGPT.A key concern of Jamix's design is data security. The tool never uses company data to train AI models. Data is encrypted and handled with strict measures to ensure protection, with access restricted to authorized personnel. The company is actively working towards SOC 2 Compliance to further strengthen its commitment to data security.Jamix fosters an interactive communication approach and encourages feedback from its users to enhance its services. It aims to provide a platform that not only eases work operations but also maintains a high standard of data privacy and security.</p>
