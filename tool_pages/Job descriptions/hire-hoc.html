            <h2>About Hire Hoc</h2>
            <p>Hire Hoc is an AI-powered tool designed to streamline the hiring process for businesses. The tool automates several aspects of the recruitment journey, making it efficient and effective. The hiring tool uses AI to generate customized job descriptions that match particular roles and skillsets. Once the job is posted and applications are received, the profiles can be imported in CSV format directly into the platform. Hire Hoc then uses its AI capabilities to screen and shortlist the candidates, matching them to the job descriptions and recommending suitable ones for the next round. It offers one-way video assessments that are AI-curated, and allow flexible candidate responses. After this, successful candidates can schedule their interview via Calendly integration, and automated reminders and follow-ups are sent out to reduce no-shows. The tool offers several built-in customization options such as adding a company's branding or setting up custom email alerts for different job roles. Additional personalization and deeper customization options are available upon contacting the Hire Hoc team. The platform is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing hiring pipelines and has round-the-clock email support for its customers. Users are charged based on usage with a credit system. The cost per action ranges from generating job descriptions to shortlisting candidates or scheduling video assessments. No credit card is required to start and users are offered 40 free credits upon sign-up. Additional credits can be purchased as needed.</p>
