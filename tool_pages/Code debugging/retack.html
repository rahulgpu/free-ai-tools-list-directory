            <h2>About Retack</h2>
            <p>Retack AI is a state-of-the-art application error monitoring and tracking tool, designed to help users not only monitor errors, but also automatically fix them. This platform can track code errors regardless of their origin and has a built-in artificial intelligence support to resolve issues in the codebase. It can detect issues in applications in real time, swiftly notifying the user either through Slack or email, enhancing problem mitigation before they escalate. The system supports many different programming languages and frameworks, such as Python, JAVA, .NET, Flutter, React, among others, thereby enabling users to monitor and fix errors in frontend web, mobile, backend, or embedded system applications. Retack AI's functionality extends to environment monitoring, whereby it can oversee production, staging, or any other type of environment for any mobile, web or server applications. A noteworthy feature is its code fix automation, where users can integrate their Git Repositories to receive merge requests for automatic code fixing. However, it's pertinent to note that certain errors which might be outside the scope of the application could pose a challenge for the AI to rectify. It is indicated that the current system has managed to solve up to 70% of application errors in backend frameworks.</p>
