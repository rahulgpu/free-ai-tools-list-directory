            <h2>About CodeAnt AI</h2>
            <p>CodeAnt AI is a tool engineered to identify and automatically repair flawed code. The system can detect various issues, such as anti-patterns, duplicate or dead code, overly complex functions, security vulnerabilities and more, offering suggestions and auto-fixes for these problems. The tool is created with the purpose to streamline developers' workflow, saving time by not only identifying but also rectifying problematic code, directly within the developers' Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and Continuous Integration (CI) systems like GitHub and BitBucket. The AI tool also documents the entire codebase, providing visibility into the code's structure and quality over time. It can operate on both file and repository levels, offering solutions at the individual file level, as well as scanning the entire codebase for potential issues. In addition, CodeAnt AI supports end-to-end integration with the development workflow and is designed to automatically address coding issues during pull requests, ensuring the highest code quality. While it is primarily aimed at developers, CodeAnt AI also provides organizations with an overview of code quality across different repositories and teams. CodeAnt AI can be deployed entirely on-prem or in Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), ensuring data safety.</p>
