            <h2>About Zanki</h2>
            <p>Zanki is an educational tool that utilizes AI and spaced repetition techniques to aid children in early reading. It offers flashcards that encompass a range of content from letter sounds to sentences. Its spaced repetition algorithm assists in ensuring the child retains the knowledge they acquire, while adapting to the user's current reading level. Additionally, it encourages user interaction via a reward system in which children earn stickers post their review sessions, keeping them motivated and engaged. The flashcard sessions are designed with time efficiency in mind, requiring only a few minutes per day. Moreover, Zanki's AI-generated flashcards provide a mix of new and review content based on the child's reading level and attention span, with each card having a parent prompt to eradicate any guesswork. In case of missed educational sessions, the system's algorithm adjusts the review schedule accordingly. Lastly, the tool is designed to be user-oriented, therefore, it adapts to the child's interests, helping to maintain their interest and involvement.</p>
