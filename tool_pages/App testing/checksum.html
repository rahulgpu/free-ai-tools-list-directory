            <h2>About Checksum</h2>
            <p>Checksum.ai is an end-to-end (E2E) automation testing tool that converts user sessions into a comprehensive testing automation pipeline for faster testing without compromising quality. The tool automatically generates and maintains E2E tests based on user sessions, reducing development time and allowing teams to focus more on shipping. It uses machine learning (ML) models specifically trained on the software's production sessions for full coverage. The tool does not require maintenance, as its AI adaptation updates tests to code changes and flakiness. Checksum.ai offers an integration process that is quick and easy. A seed test user on the production or staging environment is provided to generate tests, and the javascript software development kit (SDK) is integrated by pasting three code lines when the application is mounted. Integration is made simple with the tool's automatic and privacy-centric data collection. The data collected is similar to Fullstory or Hotjar, but inner texts are hashed for user privacy. Test results are generated using open-source frameworks such as Cypress or Playwright, and issues are detected immediately, reducing firefighting and speeding up code reviews. The tool offers an FAQ section that addresses common concerns, including how tests are generated, how new features are tested, what tests are generated and what data it collects. Checksum.ai's algorithms extrapolate from production sessions, learning user interface conventions, and generating tests for new features on the spot. The tool records user sessions in a similar way to Fullstory or Hotjar, hashes inner texts for privacy, and allows configurable privacy controls for sensitive elements. Despite its robust functionality, the tool has a non-existent impact on performance, using open-source tools used by Fortune 500 companies.</p>
