            <h2>About Viff</h2>
            <p>Viff is an AI tool that assists hotels and property managers in generating courteous and contextual responses to guest reviews. It is offered as a Chrome extension that works with all websites and property/reputation management systems and can also be used with emails. Viff learns a hotel’s tone and brand voice from the initial inputs in as little as 20 responses, allowing it to generate consistent and on-brand responses in a single click. The tool’s proprietary AI model is trained to understand various aspects of a good guest experience, such as food, cleaning, and service. Viff’s responses are designed to be professional and courteous and never say anything a hotel would not want its staff to say. The tool can handle even the nastiest of reviews. Responding to reviews improves online reputation, and Viff’s customers have experienced a 5x jump in booking volumes and a 67% improvement in TripAdvisor ranking after just six months of responding consistently to all reviews. Viff offers a free trial that includes the first 20 responses and can understand and respond in more than 20 languages. Viff is easy to install and requires zero setup and integration work, making it accessible to anyone.</p>
