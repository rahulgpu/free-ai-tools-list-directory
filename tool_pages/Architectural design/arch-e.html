            <h2>About Arch-E</h2>
            <p>Genera.so is a platform that hosts generative image applications. It provides a space for users to explore, create, and share images generated by Architectural and Interior Design AI. The platform aims to simplify the process of turning models into online applications by eliminating the need for managing GPUs. Genera.so is currently in its beta phase and is looking to onboard more models.The platform offers several generative image applications. One of them is Industrial Design, which is based on a machine learning model trained on various industrial design objects. It can be used for both sketch renders and shape explorations. Another application is Arch-E, which generates images of buildings from text descriptions and can also render architectural sketches photorealistically. Cinema AI is a photorealistic model optimized to mimic film-grain lenses and cinematic composition, allowing users to create stills from unseen movies. Dwellara: Interior Designer is an advanced AI interior designer that can visualize and redesign living spaces based on user preferences.Genera.so focuses on providing practical assistance in the field of generative image applications. It aims to cater to the needs of professionals in sectors such as architecture, interior design, and industrial design, allowing them to leverage AI technologies to enhance their creative processes and visualization capabilities.</p>
