            <h2>About Bricksee</h2>
            <p>Bricksee is an AI-powered mobile application designed to assist users in cataloguing and reorganising their LEGO bricks. Once downloaded, users are prompted to set up a profile and add their owned sets to the app's database. By detecting and identifying the bricks present in each set, Bricksee is able to provide users with a comprehensive list of their available building materials. Bricksee's feature set includes advanced detecting, which allows users to detect hundreds of bricks in a single click, and unrivaled possibilities, which provides access to over 10,000 sets that can be added to rebuild. In terms of part information, users can view how many sets contain their detected part and which sets they own, and can also add a part directly to a set they haven't saved yet. Users can access more information about their searched part, and recall the last time they searched this part for matching sets. For set information, users can see all the parts contained within their set, easily track their progress towards rebuilding their set, and access more information about their set. The app also provides in-app instructions and progress tracking. Overall, Bricksee is a useful tool for LEGO enthusiasts looking to organise their collection and make the most efficient use of their available building materials.</p>
