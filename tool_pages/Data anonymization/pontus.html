            <h2>About Pontus</h2>
            <p>Pontus is an open-source AI orchestration layer that enhances the trustworthiness of AI systems by ensuring data privacy. It accomplishes this by masking sensitive data sent to third-party services and then demasking the data on the user's own servers. With Pontus, businesses can build AI applications more quickly and confidently, as it embeds privacy measures into the AI workflow.One key feature of Pontus is its intelligent prompt sanitization functionality. It employs a similarity search algorithm to identify private and sensitive information in the data and replaces it with tokenized representations before sending it to third-party services. This provides customers with a sense of trust and privacy without compromising the effectiveness of the AI system.In addition, Pontus implements secure retrieval augmented generation techniques, enabling only sanitized and redacted documents to be shared with third-party services, such as OpenAI. This ensures that sensitive information is protected while still allowing the full power of AI models, like RAG, to be utilized.Pontus addresses the needs of enterprise clients who have stringent data protection requirements. Its privacy-first approach helps overcome the barriers businesses face when adopting AI tools due to concerns about data security. By using Pontus, large enterprises can unlock the value of AI while maintaining the trust and safety their clients demand.For those interested in using Pontus, there are two plans available. The open-source plan suits hobby projects, small startups, and non-commercial ventures, while the business plan caters to companies requiring additional support and features for on-premise deployment. Pontus also offers community support and the option to book a demo to learn more about its capabilities and how it can enhance the trust and safety of AI systems.</p>
