            <h2>About ScreenAI</h2>
            <p>ScreenAI is a macOS application designed to automate and streamline various tasks using advanced multimodal AI. Upon taking a screenshot, the AI processes and interprets its content, facilitating actions such as scheduling, explaining content, or replying to chats. The tool is designed to work in tandem with Apple's native applications. Some of its key features include effortless capture, which allows instant capture of any screen content; prompt-free operations, letting users save frequent actions as presets; and a task-focused approach for optimal performance and deep integration with Apple apps. Privacy is prioritized, with all data kept locally and partnerships only forged with trusted AI service providers. The AI analyses both text and images, and other data forms for comprehensive and accurate results. Although currently a network connection is needed, if issues arise due to network or provider services, fallback options are in place to ensure stability. While the software is fully integrated with macOS, a waitlist option for Windows is available. It offers free and pro plans, which vary based on the number of AI service credits provided.</p>
