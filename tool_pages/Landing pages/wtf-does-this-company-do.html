            <h2>About WTF Does This Company Do?</h2>
            <p>This is an interactive tool aimed at providing insights into the purpose and function of companies. It utilizes the advanced language prediction capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3 to interpret and explain the nature of different businesses based on their web content. It seems to be predominantly used for clarifying confusing or unclear company descriptions found on their landing pages. The tool also contains a unique feature named 'random website roast', offering critique on websites' design or content. However, this feature tends to occasionally produce results that some users may find offensive. This tool was developed by an individual identified as Krishnerkar on Twitter. Beyond its primary functionality, the tool provides a medium to financially support the developer. Finally, it also features sponsorship from 'Building Momentum,' a platform providing a weekly newsletter focused on SaaS product marketing, and 'WTF is Go-To-Market?' a course offering education on customer-focused product marketing strategies.</p>
