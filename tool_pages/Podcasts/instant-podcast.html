Tokens are used to indicate the remaining available creations, which reset at a specific date and time in the future.The tool showcases past episodes, providing information on their publication date, genre, and brief descriptions. Although the episodes mentioned are nonfiction, the platform does not exclusively focus on this genre.Instant Podcast emphasizes that the scripts for the podcasts are written by AI, and the developer has instructed the AI model not to generate false information. However, users are advised to remain cautious, as AI-generated content can occasionally contain inaccuracies or fabrications, particularly when discussing specific individuals or topics.The website also offers a subscription option, allowing users to receive a periodic newsletter featuring recent podcasts. The platform assures users that their email addresses will not be shared or receive more than one email per day.For further queries, users can access the FAQ section or utilize the chat function located at the bottom right of the webpage.
