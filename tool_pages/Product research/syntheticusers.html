            <h2>About Syntheticusers</h2>
            <p>Synthetic Users is a tool designed to facilitate user and market research through the use of advanced AI architecture which creates synthetic participants for testing. The tool enables users to test their product, idea or prototype without the real users, thus speeding up the decision-making process. The tool is suitable for multiple use cases such as optimizing user journeys, product discovery, product roadmap prioritization and multiple agent architecture implementation, among others. Interview tools integrated within the system allow more in-depth inquiry, generation of insight reports, annotations, and team sharing. Users can conduct vast quantitative research in minutes through surveys. Their synthetic users can be enriched with the use of RAG (Resource Allocation Graph), enabling representation of user uniqueness. The tool also provides flexibility to users in the product lifecycle, catering to needs from identification to growth. Interview types include Problem Exploration, Concept Testing, Custom Script, and Research Goal interviews, among others. It also allows proprietary data upload for further user enrichment. Synthetic Surveys offer an opportunity to conduct quantitative research on a massive scale. The popularity and efficacy of Synthetic Users are evidenced by its acceptance in various reputable platforms. The tool utilizes Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and LLaMA, and lets users upload their own proprietary data for detailed study requirements.</p>
