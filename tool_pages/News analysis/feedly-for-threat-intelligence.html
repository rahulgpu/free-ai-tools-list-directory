            <h2>About Feedly for Threat Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Feedly for Threat Intelligence is an AI-powered tool designated for real-time tracking of emerging cyber threats. The core of the platform is an AI engine that aggregates, assesses, and prioritizes intelligence information from an extensive range of sources. It offers functionality to monitor notable vulnerabilities and zero-days, investigate the behavior of specific threat actors and malware families, understand the industry-specific threat landscape, and observe niche cybersecurity subjects.Feedly AI comprehends millions of reports, articles, and social media publications daily, automatically tagging critical threat intelligence notions such as threat actors, critical vulnerabilities, indicators of compromise, industries, companies, ATT&CK techniques, and vendors among others. Its feature, AI Feeds, provides an interactive tracking and search interface that facilitates near real-time access to this intelligence data.Creating an AI Feed entails a three-step procedure that firstly involves the application of AI models to define the intelligence to gather. Following this, symbolic logic (AND, OR, NOT) operators are used to mix multiple AI models and refine the search focus. Lastly, if necessary, the sources are refined with user-specified trusted sources. AI Feeds provides the capability to add to a personal or team folder. Articles, reports or social media entries that match the indicated AI models will appear in the AI Feeds. The tool comes with a variety of pre-trained AI models, thus simplifying the process of translating intelligence requirements into AI Feeds.</p>
