            <h2>About Interview Assistant</h2>
            <p>Interview Assistant is an AI-powered tool designed to aid users during their technical interviews. This tool acts as a personal interview coach, guiding users through difficult technical and behavioral questions. The tool provides real-time suggestions and strategies to help users present their expertise with authenticity and confidence, thus relieving some of the pressures of interviewing. It caters to a wide range of technical professionals, from coders to designers to data analysts, and provides personalized assistance in any technical domain. Users pay a one-time fee, giving them total ownership of the application and continual updates with no hidden costs. Privacy is a primary focus of the tool, with all chats stored exclusively on the user's device. The interview assistant not only aids during the interview but also provides constructive feedback after the session, enhancing continuous improvement. Functionality-wise, the tool requires an OpenAI Key to operate, and it provides accurate AI-generated answers during interviews. Users can input their interview transcript and based on the content, the AI provides responses in various coding languages or in different spoken languages. The tool also offers capabilities to evaluate performances post-interview, providing a 'score', courtesy of the GPT4 model.</p>
