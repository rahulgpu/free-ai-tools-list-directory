            <h2>About Metaview</h2>
            <p>Metaview is an AI-driven tool that generates automatic interview notes for recruiters and interviewers. The tool focuses on reducing manual work and saving time by providing automatic summaries after each interview, allowing users to focus on high-quality interactions with candidates and hiring teams. Metaview is designed to seamlessly adapt to current recruitment streams without requiring significant effort. The tool can capture interviews from various sources including a user's calendar, Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), GoodTime, Calendly, and various other tools used in the recruitment process. In addition to compatibility with all video conferencing platforms, it also supports mobile calls. Metaview is not just a generic summarization tool, it is specifically built for recruiting and the context of recruiting conversations. Its capacity to synthesize notes is improved by its ability to incorporate data from other sources such as the ATS. Furthermore, Metaview prioritizes user data security and privacy, with measures put in place to comply with regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Users also have access to customizable data retention and granular access controls via SOC II-compliant security to ensure data safety. Metaview's primary value lies in its ability to allow recruiters to focus on the interviews themselves, relieving them of note-taking tasks during or after the interview.</p>
