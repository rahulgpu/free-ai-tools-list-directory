            <h2>About hirex.ai</h2>
            <p>hirex.ai is an AI-powered platform designed to make the initial round of interviews as equitable and inclusive as possible for all job applicants. The tool streamlines the interview process by providing a wide array of assessment tools available from a single dashboard. These resources include capabilities for conducting coding interviews, running MCQ tests, setting up hackathons, organizing video interviews, and deploying WhatsApp chatbots. A notable feature of hirex.ai is its incorporation of voice-based bots which facilitate the conduct of interviews at a large scale, allowing for increased efficiencies and effectiveness in candidate screening. The platform operates on the premise of automating as much of the process as possible, thereby reducing potential human bias and allowing for more equitable and fair initial interview experiences. It is believed that such an approach can be instrumental in allowing a diverse set of applicants to progress through the interview process based on merit, rather than being inadvertently hindered at the first interview stage. In addition to its inclusivity-focused features, hirex.ai streamlines the recruitment process, making it more efficient by reducing human intervention.
