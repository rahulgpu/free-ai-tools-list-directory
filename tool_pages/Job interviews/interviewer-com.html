            <h2>About Interviewer.com</h2>
            <p>Interviewer is an AI platform designed to streamline the recruitment process through end-to-end interview automation. Named Steve, the platform's AI interviewer conducts unbiased voice interviews with all candidates in the pipeline, aiming to reduce hiring time. Steve offers a suite of features which include providing audio and video recordings of each candidate's interview, instant transcriptions and summaries of interviews, and unique session links for each interview. In addition, it offers a real-time dashboard presenting all interviews and related candidate analytics. Interviewer is customizable to any company's needs, allowing each to dictate what topics are covered during interviews. This way, it automatically creates role-specific questions and case studies. One of its notable features is the ability to formulate instant follow-up questions based on the candidates' responses. Following an interview, it provides immediate scoring and takeaways, showing why a candidate did or didnt fulfill the criteria. The platform integrates seamlessly with existing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS) and communication systems. For its case-based interviews, it has built-in anti-cheating functionality like candidate video recording, voice change detection, and video recording analysis. Moreover, the AI interviewer can be used for any role, is provided with a grading bar customized to each company's standards, and pricing tier depends on the interview length and role type. Interviewer suggests that its services are generally more cost-effective than having a human team member conduct the interviews.</p>
