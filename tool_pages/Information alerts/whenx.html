            <p>WhenX is a tool that allows users to create Semantic Alerts, enabling them to monitor any question that can be answered by a website. Its primary function is to search the web and provide answers to the specified questions. Once the answer is obtained, WhenX continuously monitors the web and sends notifications via email, SMS, or Discord when there is a change in the answer.The tool offers a simple three-step process to set up an alert. Users can formulate their question, such as inquiring about the release of a new book by J.K. Rowling, and test the alert to ensure accurate results. Once satisfied, they can deploy the alert and rest assured that they will be promptly notified of any changes in the answer.It is important to note that WhenX is intended for personal use only and not for commercial purposes. The tool is proudly open source, leveraging open source software and making its code available on GitHub. WhenX was built by edmar and is hosted on Vercel.
