            <h2>About Frigate NVR</h2>
            <p>Frigate NVR is an open source network video recorder (NVR) that leverages real-time AI object detection. This tool performs all processing locally on your own hardware, ensuring that camera feeds remain within your home. By using Frigate, users can reduce false positives with local object detection, as opposed to relying on simple motion detection used by traditional NVRs. By offloading object detection to the Google Coral TPU, even basic hardware can perform advanced analysis to determine if a detected motion is a person, car, or other object of interest. This eliminates the need to send personal camera footage to the cloud for analysis, offering privacy and cost savings.Frigate's AI capabilities allow it to scrub video feeds, running over 100 object detections per second using a single Google Coral TPU. This ensures that no frames are missed. Additionally, Frigate tracks objects in real-time and can precisely determine when a person walks up your front steps or a car enters your driveway. Users can refine notifications based on these precise locations.Integration with popular home automation platforms such as Home Assistant, OpenHab, and NodeRed is also possible, allowing users to integrate object detection into their existing systems. Frigate provides a dynamic real-time video feed, rendering cameras with active detections for easy monitoring.Testimonials highlight Frigate's customizability, fast object detection, tight integration with Home Assistant, and removal of cloud dependencies while retaining object detection features and recording history. Overall, Frigate NVR offers a locally controlled, customizable, and effective security camera system for users.</p>
