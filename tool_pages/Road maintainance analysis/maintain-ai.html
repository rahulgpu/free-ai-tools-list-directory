            <h2>About Maintain-AI</h2>
            <p>Maintain-AI is an AI tool that automates the inspection, analysis, and reporting of pavement and related infrastructure performance within a road network. This tool helps improve maintenance costs as it offers a faster and more affordable way to aggregate data, allowing for more informed decisions. Maintain-AI uses computer vision and machine learning models to detect different defect types and the severity of distresses as well as identify and assess numerous associated infrastructure elements from collected road network images. Its goal is to work with the industry to help 'keep the good roads good' by delivering a solution that supports more frequent and consistent road inspections, thereby enabling a marked improvement to data collection times, subjectivity, network visualization, and understanding cost impacts when compared to other traditional assessments and approaches. Maintain-AI's philosophy is established on "Good Roads Should Cost Less", and its commitment is to help road asset professionals make more informed and timely decisions from frequently and objectively collected data utilizing an automated road surface inspection approach that identifies how pavement assets are performing. This tool enables users responsible for road network asset management to optimize the use of available funding, better communicate funding needs, more objectively assess, monitor and support the management of the entire pavement network, and improve the efficiency of other useful, more expensive systems. Maintain-AI offers flexible options with or without long-term commitments to partnering and working with like-minded organizations to collectively support the infrastructure and transport sectors to constantly improve how our most important assets are inspected, analyzed, and managed.</p>
