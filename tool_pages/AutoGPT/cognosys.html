For example, users can set up a task for Cognosys to send them a daily summary of news every morning at 8AM, or to automatically sort new emails into 'work' or 'personal' categories. Cognosys acts as a central hub for your work, seamlessly integrating with your favorite apps such as Google Calendar, Google Drive, Gmail, Notion, Google Maps, and Outlook to provide actionable insights and streamline communication. Moreover, it allows users to connect their Notion and Gmail accounts for even more functionality, such as drafting emails in Gmail based on information retrieved from Notion.Not just limited to professional tasks, it can be used for curating personalized newsletters as well.
