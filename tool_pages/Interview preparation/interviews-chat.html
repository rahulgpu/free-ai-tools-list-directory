            <h2>About Interviews Chat</h2>
            <p>Interviews Chat is an AI tool designed for comprehensive job interview preparation and assistance. It consists of two main features: 'Interviews Live Copilot' which offers live, real-time suggestions during the interview process, and 'Interviews Prep' for in-depth pre-interview preparation. The Live Copilot utilizes AI technology to listen to the interview conversation, providing on-the-spot guidance and suggestions to help you respond optimally. It also has the capability to assist with task-oriented challenges such as coding or whiteboard tasks. The Interviews Prep feature offers personalized interview questions based on job applications and provides a safe environment for realistic practice. It comes with a video interface for the user to record responses, which are then transcribed and evaluated by the AI. The system provides feedback, assessing the relevance, clarity, and confidence of the users answer to help identify areas for improvement. Notably, this feature also supports multilingualism. The tool assures data security as it does not store recorded videos or share data with third parties. The tool is browser-based and interacts with common video conferencing platforms like Zoom and Google Meet, however, the Live Copilot feature is not yet mobile-friendly. Its goal is to help users improve their interview skills, make lasting impressions, and ultimately achieve success in the job market.</p>
