            <h2>About InterviewBot</h2>
            <p>InterviewBot is a unique AI-driven tool designed specifically for providing interview practice across a wide range of subjects. It is a free web-based platform that allows candidates to record and replay their interviews. It is not just a rehearsal tool but also a comprehensive learning resource. The primary feature that distinguishes InterviewBot from general video recording platforms is its AI coaching functionality. The AI coach serves as an intelligent critique, examining user's interview performances and subsequently, suggesting areas for improvement. Analyzing aspects such as verbiage, tone, gestures, and facial expressions, the AI delivers an insightful critique after each practice session. Though it cannot replace human judgement completely, its ability to offer instant feedback makes it a highly valuable resource for individuals preparing for interviews. The feedback provided can significantly help in improving communication skills, refining responses, and enhancing overall presentation. However, potential users should understand that results may vary based on individual user actions and external circumstances. It is important to use it as a supplementary tool as part of an extensive interview preparation strategy rather than a standalone solution. Intellectual property rights, data privacy, and confidentiality measures in relation to the use of InterviewBot are issues to be reviewed by users prior to usage.</p>
