            <h2>About Interview Prep AI</h2>
            <p>Interview Prep AI is an AI-driven mobile application that helps jobseekers prepare for job interviews. It simulates realistic job interviews and provides feedback to the user, enabling them to practice and improve their interview skills. To use the tool, users can upload their CV by either pasting the text or uploading a document, and then fill out initial information such as job description, interview type, and language. Users can then practice multiple iterations of a live interview by talking with the AI bot, which provides instantaneous feedback on their performance. The application keeps the information provided by the user private and does not store it on its servers, ensuring confidentiality. The tool is geared towards job seekers who want to improve their interview skills, overcome anxiety, and increase their chances of getting a job offer. It also saves users time by allowing them to practice as many times as they want, without waiting for actual interviews. Overall, Interview Prep AI is a useful and innovative tool for job seekers to prepare for job interviews and gain confidence in their abilities.</p>
