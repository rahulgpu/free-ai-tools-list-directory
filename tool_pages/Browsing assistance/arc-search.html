            <h2>About Arc Search</h2>
            <p>Arc Search is a modern, AI-enabled mobile browsing tool designed to enhance user experience by delivering faster and more precise answers. The application functions by condensing webpages into concise insights using AI-powered summarization, which efficiently streamlines the search journey and prevents information overload. The features, 'BROWSE FOR ME' and 'PINCH TO SUMMARIZE', significantly reduce the user effort during the search process. Additionally, Arc Search provides an ad-free, distraction-free web browsing experience, blocking ads, trackers, pop-ups, and banners. The tool also has other utility features such as automatic archiving of inactive tabs and a reader mode to further minimize distractions. The software has a strong emphasis on privacy, offering advanced private browsing modes, secure tabs, and robust data protection options, ensuring secure and private user activity. The minimalist user interface subtly complements any website, and the application includes additional features that enhance usability, such as keyboard-ready start functionality and a fidget spinner logo. The tool is available for free across iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices. This application also allows users to sync their browsing activity across multiple devices. Developed by The Browser Company, a New York-based team, Arc Search is a step towards a more streamlined, personal and efficient internet browsing experience.</p>
