            <h2>About RubricPro</h2>
            <p>RubricPro is an AI-powered tool that automates the grading process. It is suitable for a variety of users including teachers, students, and professionals across different fields. With the ability to evaluate essays, CVs, business plans, and other assignment types based on user-provided rubrics, this AI works as an efficient grading companion.Teachers can utilize RubricPro as a second opinion on student work, enabling them to grade essays and assignments in batches, and then download summaries as needed. Students, on the other hand, can have their work reviewed before submission, receiving essential feedback on their output. For professionals, RubricPro is a reliable tool for evaluating CVs, leads, vendors, among other tasks. The platform doesn't store any documents after the grading process is complete, ensuring user's privacy and data protection.Moreover, RubricPro operates using pre-trained models rather than training models on user data. It offers a credit-based system that equates one credit to one graded document, and does not deduct credits when there's an error in the grading process.RubricPro also entertains feature requests from users, providing bonus credits if such suggestions are implemented. Besides individual users, RubricPro caters to enterprise needs with custom plans.</p>
