            <p>Centenarian is an ultra-personalized sleep coaching tool powered by an artificial intelligence named Supercentenarian. Its primary goal is to help users optimize their energy, focus and longevity by providing personalized sleep coaching. It collects and analyses a user's sleep data using advanced data science algorithms to offer insights and suggestions on how to achieve better sleep quality. The tool provides personalized recommendations for the user, such as stopping caffeine intake 10 hours before bedtime or taking melatonin (a natural hormone produced by the body to regulate sleep-wake cycle) for better sleep. The AI coach can also remind users to take melatonin or adjust room temperature and humidity for a better sleeping environment. It can track biometrics and learn from correlations between sleep data and factors like temperature, humidity, and lighting. By leveraging the expertise and experience of its team in wellness, performance, and longevity optimization, the AI coach provides insights and suggestions to maximize the user's wellness potential. Centenarian's coaching is informed by science and driven by data, and can be accessed anytime, from anywhere.
