            <h2>About Shine by Sunshine</h2>
            <p>Shine by Sunshine is an easy and intuitive group photo sharing app designed to create and curate shared albums. The app is particularly useful for communal photo sharing from events, trips, gatherings, and more. With just a few simple steps, users can generate an album tag with a time and place, and invite others to participate. The distinguishing feature of Shine is its AI-driven photo curation capability. Shine's AI algorithm filters through your photos and chooses the most share-worthy ones according to various parameters, such as location, time, people present, and photographic context. This process prevents unwanted photos like screenshots or personal selfies from being shared unsuitably with the group. In addition, Shine can suggest albums based on clusters of photos it identifies as potentially sharable. This unique feature reminds users of group photos they may have overlooked to share. The AI system also ensures frictionless sharing by allowing album access via code, link, or QR code, making it convenient to share with the right group of people repeatedly. Shine is also tightly integrated with event sharing. Once the event is created on Shine, an album is automatically formed linked to the event's time and location. Attendees who RSVP to the event are automatically added into the shared album, and photographs taken during the event are shared with participant's consent. Photos shared this way are well-organized, clustered, and available in high resolution.</p>
