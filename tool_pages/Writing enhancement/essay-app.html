            <h2>About Essay.app</h2>
            <p>Essay is a writing and editing tool designed to help users improve their writing skills, going beyond standard auto-correction by focusing on fostering real writing learning. The tool urges users to take their rough ideas and mould them into cogent, impactful sentences and paragraphs. The essential premise of Essay is to not just point out errors or provide auto-suggestions but to help users understand why something might be inaccurate, assisting them in becoming stronger communicators. Initially, Essay enables users to overcome the apprehension of starting a written piece by helping them put their ideas on paper. It then guides users in refining and rearranging their thoughts and sentences, maintaining the strong elements and discarding the ineffective ones. The result is a highly articulated rendition of the user's original ideas. The tool operates in two core phases: 'Creation' and 'Editing'. The 'Creation Phase' involves the formation of a base for the written work, which guides the user in maintaining focus throughout the writing process. The 'Editing Phase' involves fine-tuning each sentence and experimenting with alternate phrasings. This phase also allows for sentences to be quickly and conveniently relocated and reorganised for logical coherence and flow.Essay is versatile, with potential applications spanning multiple writing platforms, whether academic essays, publications, self-help entries, promotional emails or poems. The primary mission of Essay is to help users write better, think better and become proficient writers in their chosen domains.</p>
