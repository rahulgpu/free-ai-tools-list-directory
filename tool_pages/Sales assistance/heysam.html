            <h2>About HeySam</h2>
            <p>HeySam is an AI Sales Engineer designed to help sales teams operate more efficiently. The tool is a supporting feature for sales representatives during calls, providing immediate assistance with technical issues or inquiries, thereby reducing the need to bring in a sales engineer for each interaction. It focuses on boosting the productivity and confidence of account executives by allowing them to handle technical aspects of sales calls with less dependency on sales engineers. HeySam also promotes time management by supporting sales engineers (SEs) in reclaiming substantial portion of their time which they can then utilise for qualifying deals or focusing on larger deals. Reps can minimise the follow-up meetings as they can accomplish more in each call with HeySam's support. To use HeySam, users can simply share call transcripts, Requests for Proposals (RFPs), or other relevant sales materials, and HeySam will learn from those to provide effective support. It provides real-time answers to customer queries during calls, reducing the need for reps to manually search for information. Furthermore, it aids representatives in generating resource-based follow-up emails, helping to streamline the sales process.HeySam also includes a feature that allows call playback and provides summaries, similar to other customer interaction analytics tools. It takes user-data privacy seriously and keeps each customer's data separate. It is designed not to replace sales engineers, but to augment their effectiveness and efficiency. The AI tool is conscious of its abilities and avoids 'making things up', instead preferring to express uncertainty when lacking confidence in an answer, ensuring credibility in sales calls. It welcomes human intervention for reviewing its answers to further improve its performance.</p>
