            <h2>About Unscrambler</h2>
            <p>Unscrambler is an innovative experimental tool aiming to assist individuals who are keen to enhance their proficiency in Chinese. Designed by Dave Wilding, its primary function is to help users express their thoughts in Chinese when they are uncertain about vocabulary or grammatical nuances. The process involves the user writing their best attempt at the phrase, and then using the 'UNSCRAMBLE' feature to refine their attempt into more accurate Chinese. The tool operates on OpenAI and Microsoft services, ensuring reliable results. However, given the experimental nature of the tool, occasional inaccuracies may occur, and users are advised not to accept Unscrambler's interpretations unquestioningly. In addition to the main feature, the tool offers an example feature for those who want to understand its functionality before using it. The source code for Unscrambler is openly available on GitHub which potentially allows for customization and improvements by other interested developers. Please note that this software comes with an advisory that the interpretation of the user's input may not be completely accurate all the time.</p>
