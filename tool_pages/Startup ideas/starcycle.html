            <h2>About Starcycle</h2>
            <p>Imagine: an AI COO that can proactively draft job postings based on seasonal staffing trends; an AI CMO that can create your next paid social campaign based on current inventory and next quarter's revenue targets; or an AI CFO that can predict next quarter's inventory needs based on last year's sales data and current TikTok trends. Starcycle is a predictive analytics and enablement suite designed for small and medium businesses, empowering entrepreneurs with personalized AI-powered insights and automated tasks based on the unique needs of their business. Starcycle's first feature, currently in public beta, is the AI business planner. All you need to do is answer a few simple questions, and Starcycle will get you started on everything you need to know – 100% personalized for you, 100% AI generated. In beta, up to 5 businesses are supported. Using something every SMB owner is familiar with — the business plan — as the starting point, Starcycle will grow and evolve together with you and your business as your second brain, learning from and adding to your business context over time. Features in the works include context importing, in-line regenerating and editing, autonomous recommendations and tasks, and more. Beta users have exclusive sneak peeks to upcoming features and the ability to request new features.</p>
