            <h2>About Loti</h2>
            <p>Loti is a digital tool which automates the detection and takes down the misuse of a public figure's digital likeness across the internet. The utility serves high-profile individuals such as artists, athletes, executives, and creators and is designed to protect against fraudulent social media accounts, fake endorsements, any presence on explicit/adult content, and deepfakes. Loti provides constant web scanning services, identifying places where the individuals face or voice show up. The tool ensures control over content by structuring agreements based on factors like windowing, length of appearance, specific social/distribution channels, and geographic and spoken language. One key feature of Loti is its license management platform, which allows public figures to control their content according to the terms of their agreement and securely access their biometric data and generative AI models. It also has a robust fake account protection mechanism, frequently scanning social media to find and eliminate any account pretending to be the concerned public figure and identifying deepfakes. To manage content, Loti uses an automated, escalating takedown engine that operates around the clock. Essentially, Loti aims to protect a client's brand image, allowing them to concentrate on building their personal or professional brand.</p>
