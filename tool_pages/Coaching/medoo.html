            <h2>About Medoo</h2>
            <p>Medoo is an AI-powered coaching software designed to help coaches increase coachee retention, engagement, and throughput, ultimately leading to prized "aha!" moments. Unlike other coaching software, Medoo is built equally for coaches and coachees, co-created with their input, and powered by AI. Medoo's key feature is a shared journal that allows coaches and coachees to record their thoughts, insights, goals, and actions together in a safe space. The journal is responsive and available on desktop, tablet, and phone, enabling collaborative work across multiple devices. Medoo supports goal-setting and breaking them into actionable steps to build agency and accountability, with progress toward goals visualized in a chart. The Mind Map feature extracts themes from the journal and maps them to related goals or actions to provide new insights. Medoo also offers practical data visualizations and mind maps generated by the latest AI technology to track coachee progress. Coaches can use Medoo's custom library of resources and exercises or curate their own "coaching recipe" to encourage self-reflection. Medoo's creators claim that it makes it easy to remember where the conversation left off and not miss a beat, which can help coaches keep up with their coachees and develop meaningful relationships. Medoo offers a 1-dollar trial and provides fast and efficient customer service.</p>
