            <h2>About BigPanda</h2>
            <p>BigPanda operates as an Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) platform designed to improve IT operations efficiency. Its primary function is to enable teams to transform their IT operations with full-context AIOps for faster issue resolution and enhanced service availability. This process involves automated detection and alert intelligence, incident management, and remediation powered by AI. Unified analytics and ready-to-use dashboards aim to support continuous improvement efforts. BigPanda is committed to correlating multi-source incident data through its Unified Data Fabric, allowing for a more proactive automated incident management. Additionally, the platform allows for proactive identification of similar incidents, possibly reducing Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) rates. While BigPanda can connect to both the latest and legacy systems, its open and agnostic approach enables full context incident data to assist teams in taking action instead of spending time comparing notes. Structured to help scale various teams, BigPanda's use extends across different roles such as IT Operations, Observability, and Site reliability engineer in various sectors including Enterprises, Financial services, and Managed service providers.</p>
