            <h2>About Ceiling</h2>
            <p>Ceiling is an innovative professional networking platform designed for professionals and talent recruiters. It fuses nuanced AI technology with professional profiles, providing a fresh perspective to the world of professional networking. Rather than static profiles, Ceiling uses AI-enhanced chat to bring professional journeys to life, creating tailored and insightful conversations based on individual achievements. Despite its minimalist design, Ceiling's Wiki Cards pack a punch by offering a concise but powerful snapshot of a professional's persona. These interactive profiles offer deeper insights into a candidate's capabilities, going beyond what traditional career and networking platforms offer. For recruiters, this results in efficient pre-screening of candidates whilst saving time ordinarily spent coordinating calls. Ceiling also enables users to maintain their privacy, by letting them choose what to share and what to keep hidden. The platform is free to join and users can easily share their Wiki Cards on their resume, LinkedIn or directly with recruiters. Ceiling envisages professional networking that emphasizes substance over fanfare. This tool proves valuable to anyone seeking a more meaningful and efficient way to connect in the professional world.</p>
