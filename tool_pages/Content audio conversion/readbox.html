            <h2>About Readbox</h2>
            <p>Readbox is an innovative tool powered by advanced AI models. At its core, it's a platform that transforms long-form written content into listenable formats akin to podcasts. Users have the ability to submit a URL or forward an email to the service, which then gets converted into audio. Users are offered the option to listen to extracted content via their favorite podcast platforms, offering value in terms of convenience and accessibility, particularly for commutes, workouts, and during household chores. Readbox deeply values creators, thereby ensuring all converted content is correctly attributed to its original author and that these are only ever privately distributed. Each user's generated feed is entirely private and only accessible by them. The service operates using open standards, which makes it compatible with a variety of existing podcast players, including Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Overcast, Pocket Casts, among others. While it currently lacks integration with Spotify, future integration is planned. Alternatively, feeds can be listened to directly on the Readbox website. The tool is devoted to supporting creators in reaching new audiences in addition to enhancing the value of their work.</p>
