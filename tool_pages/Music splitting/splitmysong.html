            <h2>About Splitmysong</h2>
            <p>SplitMySong.com is an AI-based tool that allows users to split songs into vocals and instruments. With this tool, users can easily isolate individual tracks such as drums, vocals, bass, guitar, piano, and "other" from their songs. Additionally, users can adjust the volume and panning of each track using the mixer feature. The tool also offers the ability to change the tempo and pitch of the song. Once the desired mix is achieved, users can download their customized mix.The AI-powered audio separation process employed by SplitMySong.com is computationally intensive and may vary in processing time depending on the duration of the audio file. On average, the process takes approximately 1 to 3 minutes to complete. The tool supports various common audio formats such as mp3, ogg, flac, wav, and aiff. However, there are some limitations regarding file uploads. Each uploaded file must be between 0.1 and 200 MB in size, and the maximum audio duration allowed is 20 minutes. Users of the free version can only upload a maximum of two songs per day, with their songs being cropped to a random 15-second snippet before processing by the AI.The tool ensures user privacy by restricting access to songs, allowing each user to only access their own songs. Uploaded songs and processed tracks are automatically deleted after approximately one day, so it is recommended to use the download function to save results beforehand to prevent any data loss.While there is no native mobile app available, users can install the SplitMySong Web App on their mobile devices or desktops to achieve a similar experience. Overall, SplitMySong.com offers a convenient and user-friendly solution for audio separation and customized mixing using AI technology.</p>
