            <h2>About Day Flow</h2>
            <p>Day Flow is an artificial intelligence-powered daily planner designed to help users manage their everyday tasks with efficiency. The app operates as a personal assistant, completing scheduling tasks and providing insightful suggestions upon user commands. Users can voice their tasks and plans for the day or week, and the app will create a schedule accordingly. Day Flow can suggest suitable time slots for desired activities and also recommend relevant items or activities based on user requests. The application includes features for task creation, recurring task setup, reminders, and task categorization, providing a simplified overview of one's day. Importation of Calendar and Reminders is also an available feature, ensuring all daily events and tasks are kept in one place. Despite being highly intuitive, some features, including the ability to break down tasks into sub-tasks and text-based interaction with the AI component, are still in development.</p>
