            <h2>About Seekho Resume Checker</h2>
            <p>ResumeChecker is an artificial intelligence-powered platform designed to optimize resumes by providing detailed feedback, suggestions and scoring. Users upload their resume to the system, which then analyzes it against a series of industry standards. It provides comprehensive feedback on content, formatting, and optimization, highlighting areas needing improvement. Aside from analyzing industry standards, it also checks grammar and spelling, ensuring the resume is professionally presented. The system is designed to beat Applicant Tracking Systems, helping users' resumes stand out to hiring managers. Further, users receive personalized suggestions based on their particular industry and job role. Once recommendations are implemented, users can re-upload their resume to view their improvements. The ResumeChecker is designed to not only improve resumes but also save time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manual review. While the AI-based rating system provides valuable insights, it is intended to be utilized along with human feedback for an enhanced outcome. It is also significant to note that although the platform is intended to optimize the user's resume, securing a job also relies on numerous factors beyond just the resume.</p>
