            <h2>About Unstract</h2>
            <p>Unstract is an AI-driven tool designed to unlock insights from unstructured data. As a no-code platform, it processes and structures unstructured data, turning them into ready-to-use formats, making it particularly useful in automating laborious manual processes. The tool has application in several industries, especially in the fields of insurance and finance. For instance, it assists in expediting and enhancing the accuracy of document processing in insurance claims, underwriting, and KNOW-YOUR-CUSTOMER (KYC) procedures.Some notable features of Unstract include: LLMWhisperer, LLMeval, and LLMObservability. The LLMWhisperer component is designed to optimize the presentation of data from complex documents to Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMEval, on the other hand, uses two independent LLMs to validate extracted data's accuracy, providing confidence scores. LLMObservability monitors data interactions throughout a project, from its development stages to its production, providing visibility of how your data interacts with LLMs.Moreover, Unstract offers features like ETL Pipelines and API deployments to integrate unstructured data workflows into existing applications. The Automation Hub feature can structure various common unstructured documents, enhancing operational efficiency. And, with the API Hub, apps can manage unstructured data without dealing directly with LLMs. Unstract also presents a no-code feature called Prompt Studio, which extracts structured data from any document.Lastly, Unstract doesn't ignore the aspect of user interaction. It offers a DocDialog technology that allows users to interact naturally with their documents. Overall, this tool stands out for its adherence to strict rules and regulations of various compliance authorities, ensuring your data always remains safe, secure, and private.</p>
