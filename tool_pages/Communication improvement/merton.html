            <h2>About Merton</h2>
            <p>Merton is an AI-powered tool designed to provide a communication solution for voice-impaired users, enhancing their ability to express needs, thoughts, and feelings effectively. Available on Apple Vision Pro, its AI system predicts users' next phrases based on past interactions, thereby improving the speed and ease of communication. It offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to select quick phrases or create customised messages that can be vocalized through Apple Vision Pro, or mirrored to an iPad or iPhone. Merton is also equipped with a feature known as the Pain Board. Users with limited or no motor functions can use this feature to specify areas of discomfort on their body using simple eye movements with their Apple Vision Pro device. This enhances caregiver responses to pain management needs by allowing users to efficiently express their pain, even if they are unable to physically point to or speak about the precise location of their pain. Merton's features significantly enhance communication and caregiving processes, particularly for individuals who may have previously struggled to express their feelings and needs due to their condition. Therefore, it serves to support better understanding and more efficient responses to those with limited communication ability.</p>
