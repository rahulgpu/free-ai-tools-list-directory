            <h2>About Taim App</h2>
            <p>Taim is an automated time-tracking software developed for freelancers and teams alike. Its primary goal is to help users track work hours with little to no manual intervention, thus increasing billing accuracy and productivity levels. Taim takes care of tracking, freeing users to concentrate on tasks at hand. It effectively addresses issues of inaccurate timekeeping and billing, commonly encountered when timers are manually started and stopped. With Taim, users can either record sessions manually or automatically. It is designed to offer full control to users who can readily modify the duration and date of sessions to ensure correct information. Features include automatic tracking for gaining insights into frequently used apps and analytics to accurately bill and plan one's time. Users have the option to select whether a session is billable or not, simplifying the invoicing process. Taim also includes an AI feature that, over time, learns to log sessions automatically. The software also offers a data export feature to XLS, CSV, and PDF formats and allows for time and financial budget tracking. Integrations with other apps such as Asana and Jira are an added advantage. Taim has been designed with an efficient resource consumption pattern, thereby reducing the load on the device on which it runs.</p>
