            <h2>About ModerateKit</h2>
            <p>ModerateKit is an AI-based service designed to automate the moderation, reviewing, and processing of user-generated content in digital communities. This tool takes various tasks, such as post moderation and optimization, code of conduct, spam, NSFW and abuse detection off your hands. It triages, reviews, optimizes, approves, marks as spam or removes community posts, questions, and ideas. Furthermore, ModerateKit can optimize community posts to improve their titles, descriptions, tagging and categorization. This serves to enhance overall engagement within the community. A valuable feature of this tool is its ability to align moderation efforts with a company's Code of Conduct or policies, establishing an adherence to guidelines within the community. Another important feature is its ability to calculate a Community Health Score by analyzing sentiment, emotion, and toxicity in posts. This offers a general overview on the healthiness of the community. The tool is currently compatible with platforms such as Gainsight Customer Communities, Softr, and Airtable via Zapier and more integrations are under development. The content moderation service this tool provides aims to save hundreds of hours for your Community Management, Trust and Safety, and Customer Support teams, by significantly reducing manual labor.</p>
