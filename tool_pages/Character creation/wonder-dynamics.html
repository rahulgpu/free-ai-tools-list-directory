            <h2>About Wonder Dynamics</h2>
            <p>Wonder Studio is an AI tool that simplifies the process of animating, lighting, and compositing CG characters into live-action scenes. The tool eliminates the need for complicated 3D software, expensive production hardware, and shot-by-shot work. Users can upload their CG character model into a single shot or an entire scene, and the system automatically detects cuts and tracks the actor throughout the sequence using single-camera footage. The performance is then transferred to the user's preferred CG character, which is automatically animated, lit, and composed. Wonder Studio automates 80%-90% of "objective" VFX work, leaving artists with the remaining "subjective" work, which can be exported to the software they already use. The tool is adaptive, making it suitable for any existing pipeline. Wonder Studio offers multiple characters, freeing users to create sci-fi worlds by assigning multiple characters. The tool is easy to use, allowing users to focus on creative storytelling. Investors, including Samsung NEXT and Epic Games, have supported Wonder Studio. The tool features free characters from artists, and 3D artists can contact Wonder Studio to have their characters featured on the platform. Overall, Wonder Studio offers a smooth and automated process for creating impressive live-action scenes with CG characters.</p>
