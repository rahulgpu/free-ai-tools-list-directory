            <h2>About AI Video Search Engine</h2>
            <p>The AI Video Search Engine is a tool designed to simplify and streamline the process of searching within video content. By integrating natural language processing and other AI techniques, this tool allows users to input a question and quickly receive related answers extracted directly from the video content. This functionality greatly reduces the amount of time required to find specific information within videos, which traditionally involves manually scrubbing through video timelines. In addition to this search function, the AI Video Search Engine provides a chat interface for each video. This increases interactivity and allows users to engage with video content in a more dynamic and engaging way.This tool also incorporates an 'index video' feature. This involves analyzing and cataloguing video content to improve searchability, making it easier to find relevant content in the future.This AI powered tool has a broad range of applications. It can be used by individuals seeking to learn from video content more effectively, corporations aiming to optimize their internal video libraries for easy reference, education institutions making their video lectures more accessible, and many more. The software is powered by Supabase, a rapidly advancing web-based platform, and is available on Github for those interested in its source code or contributing to its continued development. It's a valuable tool for anyone seeking a more efficient method to navigate, index, and interact with video content.</p>
