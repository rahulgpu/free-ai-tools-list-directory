            <h2>About Mails.ai</h2>
            <p>Mails.ai is a specialized tool that assists with cold email outreach at scale. This artificial intelligence powered software focuses on improving email deliverability, supporting business growth, and automation of email campaigns. It does not set a limit to the number of email accounts that can be connected, allowing customization and scale. The software incorporates an array of features that support lead generation and outreach campaigns. This includes real-time email verification to ensure deliverability and engagement, automatic email warmup to enhance sender reputation and open rates, and AI-powered writing for personalized content generation. Furthermore, the software allows for endless opportunities to connect with your entire lead database. Mails.ai ensures automation and simplification of the email sequence process. There is an AI assistant which guides through the initial campaign setup. Then, the users can watch as the software autonomously continues with the campaign, from sending daily emails to adjusting sending patterns for optimization. The platform offers different tiers of services in their pricing structure, suitable to meet varying individual needs, including options for unlimited email accounts, email warmups, and active contacts. As it is flexible and scalable, Mails.ai can serve both startups and larger companies with more complex requirements.

The intent of this tool is maximizing outreach campaigns to increase replies, thus closing more deals.</p>
