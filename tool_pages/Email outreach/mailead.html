            <h2>About Mailead</h2>
            <p>Mailead.io is a specialized tool designed for cold email outreach at a large scale. The tool aims to streamline the outreach process by providing features like easy campaign setup and access. It allows unlimited email sending accounts, which means users are not constrained by a cap on the number of mailboxes they can connect and use. With this feature, users can reach a wider audience and manage diverse email campaigns without risking damage to sender reputation. Additionally, Mailead.io uses generative AI to craft personalized cold email sequences based on specific needs. The service also offers an email finder tool, providing accurate results and ensuring GDPR compliance and catch-all verification, meaning users only pay for valid emails found. It helps users design advanced and focused cold email plans, using precise targeting, testing different versions, and automated follow-ups to reach out effectively. Moreover, Mailead.io functions autonomously once the lead list is uploaded and campaigns set up, reducing manual interference. Its active contacts feature resets every month, allowing users to interact with an unlimited number of new email addresses. Sequence steps for campaign planning are unlimited, providing flexibility in adding as many steps as needed to meet campaign goals. The service offers assistance in supplying leads for email outreach upon request as well.</p>
