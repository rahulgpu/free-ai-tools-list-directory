            <h2>About Sumr</h2>
            <p>Sumr is an AI-powered tool designed to provide summaries of web content directly within the Safari browser. Integrating into Safari, Sumr uses an OpenAI API key to condense lengthy articles, product pages, company profiles and job postings, providing users with an understanding of the content without the need to read the entire item. This is specifically useful when dealing with unnecessarily lengthy or poorly written articles. Sumr also maintains an operation process that is minimal with one-button summarization and sharing. Summaries created are stored on the user's device, allowing for easy access without re-summarization saving both time and API usage costs. Moreover, summaries can also be translated into a user's chosen language or kept in the original language based on preference.In addition to its summarization capabilities, Sumr allows users to control which websites it accesses and when. It only examines a page's content when the user clicks the Summarize button, and any resulting summary can be removed completely from the device if desired. Sumr also includes sharing features that facilitate easy dispersal of summaries with accompanying source URLs. Furthermore, the tool provides options to select between different GPT models for summarization.While Sumr is primarily available on iOS, iPadOS, and MacOs, attempts can be made to have it function on Vision OS as well. The tool is cost-effective as users maintain control over costs by utilizing their own OpenAI keys and as such, there are no subscription fees. Note: Advanced features such as the ability to ask follow-up questions, alter system prompts, change the model type, and use an on-device model are currently in development.</p>
