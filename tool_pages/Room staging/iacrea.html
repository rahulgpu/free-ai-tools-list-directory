            <h2>About IACrea</h2>
            <p>IACrea is an AI-powered tool that allows users to redecorate a living space quickly and easily. Users can upload a photo of their room and select from a variety of design styles such as modern, Scandinavian, industrial and minimalist. Within seconds, IACrea generates a new design proposal using artificial intelligence, giving users the ability to visualize their space with different styles before making any actual changes. In addition to providing users with design ideas, IACrea also offers several other functionalities. For example, users can select specific areas of their room to redecorate while retaining the original style, and can even furnish an empty room virtually. The tool also has an API for developers and supports 360-degree photos for virtual tours.IACrea offers two different credit packages, starting at 35 generated photos per credit. The tool is suitable for anyone who wants to quickly and easily decorate, renovate or imagine new spaces, and is especially useful for those looking to sell or buy a property. However, users should note that the photos generated are of a lower resolution, and inconsistencies may occur. In such cases, users can either retry the design proposal or take photos from different angles to improve the results. Overall, IACrea offers a convenient and cost-effective way to visualize and experiment with different design options for living spaces.</p>
