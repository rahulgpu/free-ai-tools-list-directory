            <h2>About Novel.sh</h2>
            <p>Novel is a web-based WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to provide autocompletions. This tool is inspired by Notion, a productivity app, and aims to provide a similar experience to its users. Novel is developed using Tiptap, an open-source editor framework for Vue.js, and is powered by two AI platforms, OpenAI and Vercel AI SDK. The AI-powered autocompletions in Novel enable users to save time when writing content by suggesting the next words or phrases based on what has already been typed. This feature is particularly useful for those who write long-form content, such as essays or reports, and helps them maintain a consistent tone and style throughout their writing. The AI algorithms analyze the context of the user’s text to suggest relevant next words or phrases, which can be accepted or rejected by the user.Furthermore, Novel also provides a range of formatting options, such as headings and lists, to help users structure their content effectively. The editor has a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy for novice users to navigate.Overall, Novel is a useful tool for anyone who regularly writes online content and wants to streamline their writing process while maintaining consistency. Its AI-powered autocompletions make it stand out from other WYSIWYG editors, and its similarity to Notion makes it an appealing choice for users who are already familiar with Notion’s interface.</p>
