            <h2>About Ohai.ai</h2>
            <p>Ohai.ai is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) household assistant designed to manage various aspects of household activities, helping to reduce the workload of running a home. The tool is developed by parents, entrepreneurs, and technologists with an understanding of the difficulties of managing household calendars, to-do lists, coordinating family and caregiver activities, and coping with a vast amount of routine home management information. The AI-assistant, named 'O', is an easy-to-use provider of functionality for households, accessible through text messages. Users can connect their calendars and include necessary participants such as partners and caregivers to allow O to provide consistent coordination and assistance for the whole family. Furthermore, users can send a variety of information to O for assistance, including screenshots, photos, PDfs, and emails. Processing this information, the AI-assistant can provide daily summaries to help users prepare for the day ahead by identifying schedule conflicts, delegating tasks, and even suggesting personal time.A key feature includes helping users manage cognitive overload by simplifying and organizing tasks and responsibilities, particularly helpful for the primary household managers. It aims to ensure these 'Chief Household Officers' stay on top of their tasks without feeling overwhelmed, while offering a free trial for users to explore the software's capabilities.</p>
