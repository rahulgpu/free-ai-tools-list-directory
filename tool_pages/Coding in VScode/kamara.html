            <h2>About Kamara</h2>
            <p>Kamara is an AI-powered coding tool that helps developers to write and edit their code more efficiently. It is a VS Code extension that can be installed and accessed within the IDE. The tool leverages GPT-4 technology and allows users to describe what they want to accomplish by just providing the instructions, which Kamara then translates into code snippets. Kamara has been tested with multiple languages, but it works best with TypeScript, and it can split long files into shorter ones for better results. Furthermore, Kamara uses a credit-based pricing system, where developers pay for how much code is read and written by Kamara. The pricing is $10 for every 200k credits and users can choose the amount they want to pay. Overall, Kamara seeks to help developers save time by automating some parts of the coding process. The tool was developed by Gonza Nardini and Diego Vazquez, and the team is actively working on improving Kamara. Developers can provide feedback by filling out a form or joining the Kamara Discord server. In conclusion, Kamara is a valuable tool that can help developers streamline their coding process and increase their productivity.</p>
