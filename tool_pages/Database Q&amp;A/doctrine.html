            <h2>About Doctrine</h2>
            <p>Doctrine is an AI tool that enables users to easily add generative AI capabilities to their applications. With this tool, users can leverage the knowledge stored in their data or knowledge bases to answer user questions or integrate AI features into their apps. Doctrine offers a simple and powerful API that can be quickly integrated into applications. Users can ingest knowledge from various sources such as databases, websites, documents, images, spreadsheets, and powerpoints. The tool automatically converts different file types into text, vectorizes the text into a high dimensional vector space, and supports ingesting content from websites by crawling sitemaps or individual pages.The tool provides a ready-to-use Chat UI that can be embedded into applications, or users can utilize the API to build their own UI. Multi-tenant databases are supported, as Doctrine simplifies the partitioning of vector embeddings to ensure the security of customer data.Scalability is another advantage of using Doctrine, as it offers a scalable infrastructure to handle document processing, vector generation and storage, and user query requests. Doctrine provides different pricing plans to accommodate various needs. The Starter plan is suitable for personal use or smaller projects, while the Growth plan is designed for growing businesses. The Business plan is aimed at organizations looking to incorporate AI across their entire operation. The tool also offers comprehensive documentation for users to get started and explore its features and functionalities.</p>
