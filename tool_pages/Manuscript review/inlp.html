            <h2>About iNLP</h2>
            <p>iNLP is an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform designed for academic, journal, and manuscript evaluations. It serves as an AI-powered tool that automates the process of language assessment and copyediting content. Developed with an aim of improving content quality, iNLP not only brings streamlined efficiency, but it also lends itself to overall productivity increases in editorial workflows. This tool encompasses various features that assist in automated language assessment for manuscripts, thereby potentially reducing the associated costs. A notably feature is its ability to be swiftly integrated and deployed through Quixl, an AI accelerator platform. However, it's always crucial to understand that while iNLP delivers a high level of automation, it's still essential to incorporate a human touch in terms of content interpretation and final review. iNLP is an ideal tool for publishers, academic institutions as well as content-driven enterprises looking to enhance their language quality assessment process.</p>
