            <h2>About Landy</h2>
            <p>Landy is an AI-powered tool for real estate transactions designed to streamline the purchasing process for buyers. As an AI buyer's agent, Landy operates by offering a platform where buyers can import links from property listings on Zillow. After a link is imported, Landy assists in sending AI-powered offers to sellers, enabling negotiations and transactions to occur efficiently and directly. In addition, users can also leverage Landys optional Premium review where a team of licensed real estate agents prudently reviews the offer before it gets sent out and provides feedback within 24 hours. A distinctive feature of Landy is its zero-commission model that is geared towards lowering total mortgage payments by helping buyers avoid paying a buyer's agent commission. The platform bridges the gap between buyers and sellers with the intent to bypass conventional methods that typically include agent's commissions, aiming to make real estate transactions more cost-effective for buyers. However, Landy does charge a nominal fee both for initiating the offer and for the final closure of the deal. The tool is functional only in certain areas, currently limited to the Nashville region.</p>
