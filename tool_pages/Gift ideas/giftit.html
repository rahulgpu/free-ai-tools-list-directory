            <h2>About Giftit</h2>
            <p>Giftit is an AI tool designed to help users choose suitable gifts by engaging their contacts in anonymous, automated conversations. The tool uses a persona named 'Sherlock' who can communicate with your friends through popular messaging platforms like WhatsApp and iMessage. Based on these interactions, it helps identify potential gift items. The application is built for various occasions, such as birthdays, graduations or spontaneous gifting moments. Users start by selecting a contact, after which Sherlock interacts with the chosen friend. This interaction is completely anonymous, allowing users to stay behind the scenes. Subsequently, users can view the results from the discussion between Sherlock and their friend, aiding them to select the perfect gift. The outcome can be viewed either as a full conversation transcript or as a summary generated by the software. The tool has been positively reviewed by users for its human-like interaction and its ability to help think of unique gift ideas. According to the available information, Giftit has a user-friendly interface and is created and managed in Europe.</p>
