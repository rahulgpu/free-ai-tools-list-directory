            <h2>About EssayGrader</h2>
            <p>Essay Grader AI is an AI-powered platform that assists in the grading process of essays. It helps to significantly reduce the time teachers spend on grading essays by providing accurate and specific feedback. The AI system is trained on vast amounts of diverse text data, which helps it to yield accurate and in-depth feedback from students' essays. It performs analysis on grammar, punctuation, spelling, coherence, clarity, and writing style and generates detailed reports about the errors found along with suggestions for corrections. It allows for bulk uploading, making the process easier for grading multiple essays at once. One of the tool's features is the creation of custom rubrics, which are then used to grade essays based on the teacher's existing grading criteria. The system also offers a summarizer feature, providing a concise summary that includes the most important information and unique phrases. Additionally, the AI system has an AI detector feature, which helps to determine if an essay or parts of it were written using AI. The teachers can also organize their students' essays by creating classes within the platform. This technology seeks to transform the grading experience for teachers and students alike by making it more efficient, thus lightening the workload of educators.</p>
