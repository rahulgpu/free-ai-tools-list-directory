            <h2>About Magify.design</h2>
            <p>Magify.design is an AI-based tool that offers generative UI/UX and code generation using AI prompts, making the design process faster and more efficient. The tool generates designs based on your existing design system, making it easy to integrate with your current practices. You can edit using prompts through text or voice inputs, enabling you to make modifications to the design quickly and accurately. Additionally, Magify.design generates code in frameworks like React and React Native and image assets based on the prompts, design, and UX writing. The tool can also help generate contextual UX writing based on your design. Magify.design aims to simplify the design process and make it more accessible to designers of all skill levels, freeing them up to focus on creative problem-solving and providing a better experience for users. The tool is compatible with Figma and is designed to deliver exceptional user experience. Its AI-generated designs are based on your design systems, making it a reliable and efficient tool for designers who want to achieve consistency in their design output. However, it is important to note that the tool is currently only available for early access, and interested parties can get in touch with the Magify Design team to learn more.</p>
