            <h2>About Interactive Mathematics</h2>
            <p>The AI Math Problem Solver by Interactive Mathematics is a state-of-the-art math problem solver and math tutoring chat platform. They have combined a powerful mathematical computational engine with large language model artificial intelligence to provide instant step-by-step answers to math homework problems. Their AI math problem solver and math calculator can solve tough word problems, algebra equations, and advanced calculus. Additionally, their solver can interpret math word problems and determine the necessary mathematical operations to solve the problem. Students can upload a picture of their math problem or enter it manually to get a step-by-step solution immediately. The AI Math Problem Solver is available 24/7, meaning students can get math help whenever they need it. The time it takes to solve each problem is dependent on the complexity of the problem. The AI has been trained on physics concepts and problems, but if it can't answer a question, subscribing to their Tutoring service can connect students with a physics tutor.The AI Math Problem Solver is optimized for mobile and tablet devices, so there is no need to download another app onto students' phones. An internet connection is required. They offer a free-trial with unlimited math solutions for only 0.33 cents per day and partnered with leading academic businesses to provide exclusive discounts and free services valued at $1085 to remove the costs that get in the way of academic success.</p>
