            <h2>About Opera One</h2>
            <p>Opera One is a newly redesigned flagship browser that comes with an integrated, native browser AI called Aria, making it the first browser of its kind. Aria can be accessed via a new command line or from the browser sidebar and offers free access to OpenAI's GPT-based solution along with up-to-date information from the web. Opera collaborated with OpenAI to create Aria, and it is enhanced by additional capabilities such as adding live results from the web. Aria is knowledgeable about Opera's entire database of support documentation and uses the company's current product knowledge to answer users’ questions. The AI in Opera One is a user-controlled experience, and users can choose to opt into AI services or not engage with them. Opera One features Tab Islands that keep related tabs together based on context in an intuitive way. With Tab Islands, users gain flexibility in interacting with their tabs and can easily distinguish the topics they were focusing on and switch between them. Opera One also boasts a new modular design and a new architecture with a multithreaded compositor that allows for smoother navigation than ever before. The new design philosophy allows Opera to build a more powerful and feature-rich browser that is ready for a generative AI-based future. Overall, Opera One is a unique and innovative browser for those looking for a new and improved browsing experience with a focus on user-controlled AI and intuitive tab management.</p>
