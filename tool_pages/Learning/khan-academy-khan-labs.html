            <h2>About Khan Academy &#8211; Khan Labs</h2>
            <p>Khanmigo, developed by nonprofit organization Khan Academy, is an AI-powered teaching assistant and personal tutor. It serves as an on-demand support tool for both learning and teaching processes, providing a unique platform for teachers, learners, and parents. For teachers, Kahnimigo is designed to simplify tasks such as differentiation, lesson planning, rubric creation and more, with an intent to reduce busy work significantly.

Parents can use Khanmigo as a reliable source for on-demand homework helping their children discover answers on their own. This tool is ethically designed with a focus on safety and efficient learning. Khan Academy stresses that unlike other AI tools, their AI assistant, Khanmigo, prioritizes guidance over direct answer provision, aiming to deliver a more engaging and insightful learning experience for its users.</p>
