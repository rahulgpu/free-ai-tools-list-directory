            <h2>About Heuristica</h2>
            <p>Heuristica is an AI-powered tool designed to aid in learning, research, and creative thinking through the use of visual concept maps. It uses artificial intelligence to provide an immersive research experience. Users can explore various subjects in depth, from software development to physics, creating meaningful connections between concepts with the help of AI. The tool is powered by ChatGPT and offers a mind map-like interface to structure and visualize concepts, making acquiring and organizing knowledge simpler and more structured. No prompt engineering is necessary; users can simply click buttons to dig deeper into a subject. Heuristica also offers special features such as ELI5 (Explain Like I'm Five), summarize, elaborate, and analogize, aiding in the learning process. It also provides the ability to generate AI-made flashcards from your concept maps to assist in retaining knowledge. Another significant feature is its ability to transform research into engaging content such as summaries, blog posts, or essays. Heuristicas vast sources include related articles from Wikipedia, papers from arXiv and Semantic Scholar, abstracts from PubMed, and various online resources such as YouTube videos, podcast transcripts, and news articles. Heuristica is multi-lingual and supports concept map generation in various languages, making knowledge more accessible globally.</p>
