            <h2>About Offthreadr</h2>
            <p>Offthreadr AI is an AI-enabled platform that facilitates the creation and delivery of courses, aimed at enhancing the learners' completion rates. It emphasizes on effective 'on-the-go' learning, enabling users to interact directly with course materials and get their queries resolved instantly.
