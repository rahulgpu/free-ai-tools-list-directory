            <h2>About SchoolXpress</h2>
            <p>SchoolXpress is an AI-powered educational tool aimed at transforming and personalizing learning. Its primary function is to turn various forms of learning content, such as books, handwritten notes, classwork, and other documents, into interactive and easily understandable material. The platform leverages AI to generate summaries, interactive explanations, and potential quiz, test, or exam questions from your uploaded content. The 'Chat with Document' feature allows users to pose questions to their learning material and receive detailed responses. The tool also supports content interaction in more than 50 languages and provides automated references for queries and interactions. Additional features include creating transcripts from audio recordings and a Question Maker for generating multiple-choice or open-ended questions. Particular attention is given to voice interactions - the platform can respond to user inquiries in multiple languages with clear audio, making learning possible even while performing other activities such as driving or working out. SchoolXpress employs high-end AI models including GPT-4 and Claude2 to create personalized chatbots for users. It augments traditional learning processes by making educational content more accessible, organised and insightful. The tool also facilitates document search and retrieval, providing an AI-powered search capability that locates specific content based on a few key words or phrases. In addition, it is equipped with the capacity for intelligent document summarization, offering brief overviews of key points within a document upon request. SchoolXpress aims to revolutionise learning by providing direct interaction with learning content and offering a new educational approach that is both insightful and highly efficient.</p>
