            <h2>About Study Like Pro</h2>
            <p>Study Like Pro is an AI-driven service designed to assist users in creating structured, high-quality training courses. The tool offers a variety of features that aim to enhance the organization and transformation of raw materials into coherent and structured lessons. These features include a user-friendly text editor that facilitates the drafting and saving of work, as well as an AI component that helps reorganize and streamline materials for course creation. A unique aspect of this tool is its 'lessons history' function that allows users to access previous versions of their documents, providing a useful means of tracking changes and restoring older versions of content. In addition to these features, working in Study Like Pro equips users with practical tools for comfortably working with notes and assisting with information structuring. While the service aims to assist with organization and streamlining, it does not rewrite the original content but instead provides means for better organization. Making work faster and more comfortable is central to the service's ethos, with speed emphasized as a key deliverable. The tool is developed by Oscar Studio, with Oleg Maslov as the Backend Team Lead, Nikita Shumeiko as the Frontend developer, and Oscar Studio serving as Support Consultant.</p>
