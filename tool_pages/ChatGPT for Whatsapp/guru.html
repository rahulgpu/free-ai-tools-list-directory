            <h2>About Guru</h2>
            <p>Guru is an AI-powered knowledge management tool designed for enterprises. Primarily described as a next-generation knowledge platform, it serves multiple purposes such as a search tool, wiki creator, and intranet device. The tool searches across various company platforms - from docs and chats to apps - providing instantaneous answers and allowing for a more streamlined workflow. Guru applies Natural Language Processing to deliver relevant information based on various factors such as the user's role, location, past activity, and current focus. The AI-powered engine indexes and understands this scattered information, and makes it accessible at one place, effectively acting as a single source of truth. Information is presented to teams proactively, tailored to their context and precisely when needed. Aside from its search functionalities, Guru acts as a company wiki as well, automatically compiling gathered information which can be used to increase employee engagement and productivity by reducing time wasted on searching for necessary data or instructions. To ensure accuracy and relevance, the tool includes a built-in verification feature. With integration capabilities, Guru can connect to existing workflows and tools, allowing companies to keep their current systems while benefiting from the efficiency and organization that the Guru platform provides.</p>
