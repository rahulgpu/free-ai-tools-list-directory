It also assigns objective scores to each category to help designers understand the strengths and weaknesses of their design.Design Buddy aims to improve the design process by assisting designers in identifying often-overlooked design flaws, ensuring that the design proposals are well-polished before being presented to stakeholders such as product managers, teams, or clients. By providing feedback at the design stage, the tool helps reduce the need for future revisions, potentially saving time and promoting efficiency. This plugin is integrated directly into Figma, allowing users to select specific design sections for review and receive instant feedback.Design Buddy operates on a subscription model, offering various plans that cater to different user requirements, from individual professionals to collaborative teams. Each subscription comes with a monthly review quota, and users choose their respective plan based on their review needs.The user experience of Design Buddy is made straightforward and user-friendly: after choosing a plan, users receive an API key to activate the plugin within Figma, then its ready to use.
