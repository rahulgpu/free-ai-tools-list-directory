            <h2>About HeyPhoto</h2>
            <p>HeyPhoto is an online photo editor that utilizes artificial intelligence to modify elements in images. Its capabilities include editing facial attributes, such as changing hairstyles, adjusting emotions, applying makeup, and editing age. The service is straightforward and does not require specialized skills for operation. It operates best with quality photos where faces are directly aimed at the camera. The AI technology of HeyPhoto detects faces in uploaded images and modifies them based on the selected features by the user. This AI photo editor is considered perfect for tasks like fine-tuning selfies, group photos, changing gaze direction, skin tone, hairstyle, and other facial features. It also offers an 'anonymizer' feature, primarily designed to help individuals protect their identity by becoming unrecognizable to face recognition systems. HeyPhoto also allows users to generate photorealistic headshots with the 'Face Generator' feature. An added advantage of using the service is that it securely stores the uploaded images for quick access, with an option for the user to delete them anytime if they wish.</p>
