            <h2>About Polarr Next</h2>
            <p>Polarr Next is a web-based, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled tool designed for photo editing. It incorporates an adaptive AI system that learns the user's aesthetics and implements it across photo editing tasks, hence ensuring a high level of consistency. A core feature of this tool is its AI's ability to simulate the user's editing style in real time, thereby drastically reducing the normal workload.This AI-centric tool is designed to provide an instant feedback loop; modifications made by the user are instantly incorporated into the editing process of other relevant photos. A distinctive quality of Polarr Next is its powerhouse capability of importing a vast number of RAW files at an impressive speed, secured by its proprietary web processing engine.Users can edit a reference set of photos while the tool suggests images to edit, or choose pre-trained AI styles. Subsequently, the AI system then applies these reference edits to the rest of the photos, learning from tweaks made on the fly. This adaptive tool becomes smarter with each alteration made by the user, ultimately providing an even more personalized service.Polarr Next's proprietary RAW engine ensures files remain offline during the import process, thereby safeguarding security. Furthermore, it features adaptive learning for all types of masks, including radial, gradient, subject, and background masks. Users can also leverage pre-trained styles for their photo edits.Despite its advanced features and capabilities, Polarr Next maintains a user-friendly interface with a minimal learning curve, suitable for both professional photographers and avid photo editors.</p>
