            <h2>About Online AI Image Enhancer</h2>
            <p>The Online AI Image Enhancer is a tool designed to improve the quality of photos using various techniques. The principal purpose of the tool is upscaling, a process used to increase the resolution of images without diminishing their quality. It's an effective solution for working with low-resolution images that require enhancement to be used in higher-resolution scenarios. Another integral part of its functionality is denoising, which focuses on reducing any noise present in the image, enabling cleaner, more aesthetically pleasing results. Restoration is another capability of the tool, which works to repair potential structural or color issues within an image, often left by the ravages of time or damage. The tool also includes a feature for Face Refinement, a process that improves the aspects of an image related to faces, honing features for more visually arresting portraits. It needs to be noted that all these processes are fueled by AI protocols, which automates the enhancement process, hence providing a swift, user-friendly experience. The tool's high versatility enables it to be utilized for a broad spectrum of applications, from personal photo improvements to professional photo editing needs. Due to its AI capabilities, results from this tool are often superior and achieved faster compared to traditional manual photo enhancement methods.</p>
