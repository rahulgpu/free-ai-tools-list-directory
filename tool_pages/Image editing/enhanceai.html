            <h2>About enhanceAI</h2>
            <p>enhanceAI is an AI-powered mobile application developed by 3DTOPO Incorporated. This tool primarily focuses on improving the overall quality of images by automatically processing and refining parameters such as noise, blur and resolution. enhanceAI leverages machine learning to interpret and enhance low-quality or imperfect images. With features like the optional Super Resolution, the application can amplify the overall detailing of an image by a substantial amount.The application's Image Reconstruction capability uses neural network models trained on high-quality images to properly re-assemble imperfections in a given image - which includes blurry, soft, low-resolution and noisy images - often yielding significantly improved results.Another highlight is the Super Resolution mode, an in-app feature that serves to enlarge images while maintaining quality. It does so by predicting the high-resolution versions of the images using its trained neural network, thereby enhancing their detail to a considerable degree.Although heavily-built images take time to process, the user is granted the convenience of cropping the image in the app itself, only keeping the parts that need running through Super Resolution. These set of operations can greatly improve the user experience, especially for processing large-scale prints.Please note that certain features may require an iPhone with an A15 or better processor, an iPad with M1 chips or better, with 5 GB or more RAM for optimum function.</p>
