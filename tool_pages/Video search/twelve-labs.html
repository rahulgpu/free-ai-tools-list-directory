            <h2>About Twelve Labs</h2>
            <p>Twelve Labs is an AI-driven video search platform that helps developers create applications that can see, listen, and understand the world like humans. It does this by providing developers with the most powerful video search API. Twelve Labs recently raised $12 million in seed extension funding and partnered with Oracle to bring video understanding to market.The Twelve Labs platform works by extracting key features from video such as action, object, text on screen, speech, and people. It then transforms this information into vector representations, enabling fast and scalable semantic search. Its AI models outperform open-source and commercial models, recently ranking #1 in the video retrieval track from the 2021 ICCV VALUE Challenge hosted by Microsoft.The platform is also customizable to fit specific needs, offering multimodal contextual understanding and easy integration with just a few API calls. It is used by developers and product managers to build applications with a rich understanding of video content.Twelve Labs provides a suite of APIs and a playground to help developers quickly and easily make their video catalogs searchable. It is used in a variety of applications, such as contextual advertising, content moderation, evidence search, content search, media analytics, digital asset management, brand safety, lecture search, video recommendation, and video editing.</p>
