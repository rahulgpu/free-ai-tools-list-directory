            <h2>About Slated</h2>
            <p>Slated is a tool that offers one-click scheduling and automated note-taking, designed to personalize your team's scheduling needs. In the private beta stage, the tool aims to minimize sub-optimal tasks by maximizing productivity, focus time, and overall happiness. By analyzing everyone's availability and preferences, Slated finds the ideal time and location for group meetings. Unlike impersonal time slots, Slated provides a personalized scheduling experience where invitees can share their availability anonymously or overlay their calendar to determine the best meeting time. With one click, the tool's algorithm checks participants' schedules and preferences, then schedules the meeting accordingly. Importantly, Slated links can be reused without revealing a user's full availability to everyone, and preferences are shared only with Slated, not the entire team. This eliminates the need for back-and-forth communication and allows everyone to input their availability conveniently. Additionally, Slated offers an AI-assisted note-taking feature, smart scheduling links, personalized smart calendars, focus time management, and integrations. The tool has received positive feedback from users who appreciate its simplicity and effectiveness in improving day planning and meeting coordination. As Slated operates in the private beta phase, interested users can join the waitlist to be among the first to experience its benefits.</p>
