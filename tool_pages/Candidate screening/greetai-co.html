            <h2>About Greetai.co</h2>
            <p>GreetAI is an AI-driven tool that offers smart screening services for job applicants. It uses an AI-powered interviewer to screen applicants on a large scale, providing screening capabilities anytime and anywhere. The platform allows recruiters to create job descriptions and share the link with applicants. Once applicants apply for the job, the AI interviewer conducts pre-screening and live interviews, providing a summary of the interview along with a Matching Score. In addition to applicant screening, GreetAI also offers the option for individuals to assess their own skills. Users can schedule an AI meeting and receive instant interview results via email. For recruiters, GreetAI simplifies the hiring process by generating job descriptions that serve as guidelines for the AI interviewer. The AI compares applicant responses to the job description, ultimately providing a match score to help streamline the selection process. It is worth noting that GreetAI is currently free to use, and recruiters can post as many jobs as desired. However, there is a limit of 20 interview credits, which allows for 20 AI-conducted screening interviews. To learn more about GreetAI's services, users can refer to their website's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. The tool can also be found on LinkedIn and Twitter for further engagement.</p>
