            <h2>About Welltested</h2>
            <p>Welltested.ai is an AI Autopilot tool that has been designed to help developers add 100% test coverage to their codebase in minutes. It integrates as a package with your Flutter codebase and generates test cases as you write code. This ensures stable Welltested PRs and well-tested apps for your users. The AI tool works alongside developers and generates thoughtful test cases for your code. You don't have to shift between IDEs to generate tests or mark any class that you want to test with @Welltested annotation as the tests are generated automatically. It generates meaningful test cases, which simulate a wide range of input conditions, edge cases, and user interactions to ensure the code behaves as expected under every possible condition. The AI system is designed to learn from its mistakes, and developers can save the final test back to the system. If any syntax issues or errors occur in the generated tests, the necessary fixes can be made and saved, and the AI will analyze these changes and learn from them, preventing the same mistakes from happening again.Welltested.ai enables early detection and prevention of over 10 different kinds of bugs, such as logic errors, state management issues, and validation errors, resulting in enhanced code quality. It promotes well-structured, readable and maintainable code that follows best programming practices such as SOLID principles. Ensuring code changes pass all unit tests helps maintain the stability of existing features, which reduces the risk of regressions. Welltested.ai supports all kinds of architectures like MVVM, Clean architecture and state management solutions as long as the basic testability principles are followed. The tool offers a free plan for personal projects and trying their testing AI, while for production projects and growing startups, they have premium plans with the best quality unit tests, code architecture tips, priority support, and fully private data.</p>
