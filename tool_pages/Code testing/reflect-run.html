            <h2>About Reflect.run</h2>
            <p>Reflect is an automated web testing platform that aims to simplify and optimize the end-to-end testing process. Reflect boasts new AI features which assist in creating maintainable tests that improve test coverage and identify more bugs without disrupting the development cycle. With its no-code architecture, Reflect enables the creation of end-to-end test suites that can be executed up to ten times faster than code-based regression software. Reflect's visual testing feature is designed to help detect and fix visual regressions before they are released to users. With its built-in scheduler and integration with different CI/CD solutions, Reflect makes it easy to execute end-to-end tests automatically on any deployment. This saves users time, effort and ensures end-to-end test coverage with every release. Reflect supports virtually any web action, including file uploads, drag-and-drop, and iframes, making it an accurate and resilient test automation tool. Furthermore, Reflect runs tests fast, parallelizes them, and all plans come with unlimited test runs, which means that users can run as many tests as they want, as often as they'd like without worrying about limitations in their plan. Reflect is trusted by many companies to help increase software quality, and it caters to a wide range of users, from developers to product experts and QA testers.</p>
