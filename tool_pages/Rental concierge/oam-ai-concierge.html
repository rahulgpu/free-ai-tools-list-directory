            <h2>About OAM AI Concierge</h2>
            <p>OAM AI Concierge, also known as OAM, is an AI tool designed specifically for short-term rental operators to manage their hospitality services more efficiently. Acting as a personal assistant for guests, OAM is dedicated to helping hosts navigate repetitive tasks and frequently asked questions by providing prompt and precise automated responses. The AI tool is focused on enhancing the check-in and check-out process, sending automated reminders to guests to check-out on time, and collecting feedback after their stay. Additionally, the tool is equipped with a feature that enables hosts to upload their property's manual and other relevant documents, which the chatbot then uses to respond to guests inquiries accurately. Furthermore, OAM uses its vast library of information to offer personalized recommendations to guests, thereby enhancing their stay. With its automated services, OAM helps improve response rates and potentially increase host ratings across platforms. The platforms capabilities are not limited to a single language, offering multi-lingual support to cater to a diverse guest range. OAM also provides a central dashboard for property management, displaying real-time status and information. There is no need for an app download as OAM operates via SMS or WhatsApp, improving accessibility. Added security measures are in place with each property being assigned a unique 16-digit passcode to ensure guests only access information about their specific unit.</p>
