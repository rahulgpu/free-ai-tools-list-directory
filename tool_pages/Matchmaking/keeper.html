            <h2>About Keeper</h2>
            <p>Keeper is an AI-guided matchmaking service designed to help individuals find serious and long-term partners. Unlike the common dating platforms, Keeper focuses on setting up high-confidence matches intending to facilitate committed relationships. Utilizing artificial intelligence, relationship psychology, and detailed user preferences, Keeper assesses potential matches to introduce users to individuals meeting their criteria. Some of the unique features include psychometric testing and deep questioning to ensure compatibility. Instead of relying solely on AI algorithms, Keeper also employs real human matchmakers to ensure personalized and tailored matchmaking. The focus here is on quality rather than quantity, so the matchmaking process may take more time. Users can express their detailed preferences, upon which the platform tries to find a match aligning with the stated preferences. Given the specific focus on creating serious relationships, Keeper may not be the best fit for individuals who are just looking to 'play the field' or date casually. Although primarily designed for users in North America and the UK, Keeper accepts members from across the globe. The service is currently only available in English.</p>
