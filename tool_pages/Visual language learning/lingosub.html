            <h2>About LingoSub</h2>
            <p>LingoSub is an AI-powered tool for learning languages through video content. It offers users the opportunity to watch videos with subtitles in their target language, assisting in the comprehension of new words and phrases in contextual settings. A standout feature is that users can tap on any word to view its definition and pronunciation, reinforcing learning. The tool uses the comprehensible input method, exposing learners to content slightly above their current proficiency level, leading to more natural language acquisition. Content is presented at a slower pace with simplified vocabulary, which is beneficial for beginners. LingoSub's library contains a considerable range of handpicked channels dedicated to language learning, with content across various topics to cater to various interests. Despite this focus on language learning channels, users can also watch videos not specifically for language learning, allowing full immersion in the target language. Users can suggest videos or channels to be included in LingoSub's library. The tool supports several languages and is designed with a responsive interface for learning on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Suitable for any proficiency level, from beginners to advanced learners, LingoSub is a flexible and comprehensive tool for anyone looking to learn a new language through engaging content.</p>
