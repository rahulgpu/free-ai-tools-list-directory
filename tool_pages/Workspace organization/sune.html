            <h2>About Sune</h2>
            <p>Sune is an AI tool designed to create a collaborative workspace for users to bring their documents, projects, and tasks to life in a new way. It offers an infinite canvas, functioning as a virtual whiteboard, where users can visually organize their work in a way that makes sense to them. Users can add various elements such as text, images, tables, kanban boards, calendars, sketches, and more to their workspace.One of Sune's key features is its ability to create and edit blocks within the workspace. Users can select an item, make a request, and watch as Sune creates, edits, and iterates on it. With Sune, the workspace doesn't merely host documents, but actively participates in creating and customizing blocks, allowing users to tailor the workspace to their specific needs.Sune also provides automation capabilities, allowing users to scale their work infinitely and streamline their projects for maximum efficiency. By connecting blocks and integrating services, tasks can be automated, enhancing workflow productivity.Additionally, Sune goes beyond basic file names and text to understand the content within the workspace, providing better contextual understanding. This enables Sune to offer personalized services and automation based on the user's workspace content.Overall, Sune offers a dynamic workspace where work is not static but actively powered by understanding and automation. It aims to foster collaboration by acting as more than just a tool, but as a teammate in the creative process.</p>
