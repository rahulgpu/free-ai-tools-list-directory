            <h2>About Stocked AI</h2>
            <p>Stocked AI is a tool designed to assist long-term investors in making stock trading decisions. The platform uses proprietary machine learning models to generate market-beating stock recommendations. The primary function of the tool is to provide monthly stock picks which aim to outperform the S&P 500 index. This function is designed to eliminate the emotional bias from investing and provide data-backed choices for users. The tool's quantitative trading models are constantly analysing data, with the objective of optimizing results. Stocked AI is implemented for a diversified investment approach, as it may focus on various sectors over time based on where the best opportunities are identified. Upon subscribing, users receive an email containing the tool's past picks, followed by monthly emails detailing the AI picks for the upcoming month. The tool's primary strategy includes purchasing the recommended stocks and selling them 12 months later, although users can choose to modify this strategy. It should be noted that results are evaluated on the performance of the entire portfolio rather than individual picks, and past performance is not indicative of future results. As such, investors are recommended to take their personal financial situations and objectives into account when using the service.</p>
