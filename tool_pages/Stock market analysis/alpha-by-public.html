            <h2>About Alpha by Public</h2>
            <p>Alpha is an artificial intelligence-based investment exploration tool provided by Public Holdings, Inc. and powered by GPT-4, a generative large language model from OpenAI. Alpha is designed to help investors understand and analyse financial markets in real time. It provides a summary of stock news headlines and detailed analysis with the aim of enhancing your investing insights. With Alpha, investors can screen market trends, explore different investment options such as stocks, ETFs, bonds, treasuries, investment plans, and cryptocurrencies. It also offers resources like the treasury yield curve, treasury bill overview, bond screening tool, and high yield savings calculator. It is important to note that any output by Alpha should not be taken as investment advice or recommendation to buy or sell a security but should serve as a basis for one's independent appraisal of the situation. Alpha is accessible on every asset page on Public, and you can ask any query and inform your investment decisions with precise financial data. The tool synthesizes financial data and presents it through an intuitive, natural-language interface, making it easier for investors to handle and understand complex financial information.</p>
