            <h2>About Life Story AI</h2>
            <p>Life Story AI is an application using artificial intelligence (AI) to help individuals document their life stories or the life stories of the members in their family. This state-of-the-art tool employs a virtual personality named Lisa, who acts as a personal biographer. Through vibrant interactions, Lisa guides users by asking relevant questions which are personalized and adjusted based on past responses. Users can choose to answer some questions while skipping others, creating a flexible path for narration. This tool doesn't require any typing as Lisa records all the interactions, transcribing every voice note into text instantaneously. She also takes care of grammatical edits and spelling corrections, restructuring the transcriptions into an easy-to-read style and formatting them into chapters. Users can further customize the text, the cover and even add photos, creating a fully personalized, print-ready book. An additional feature of Life Story AI is its quiet ease of use, offering two interaction modes, autonomous or guided, based on the user's confidence with the tool. The final product users receive is a physical book with up to 250 pages mailed to them that captures family narratives in a substantial format.</p>
