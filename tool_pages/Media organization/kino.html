            <h2>About Kino</h2>
            <p>Kino AI is an AI tool designed specifically for filmmakers to process and organize their footage. It acts as an assistant editor, digital imaging technician, and script supervisor all in one. With Kino AI, filmmakers of various types, including documentarians, short film directors, commercial editors, content creators, music video directors, TV studios, feature editors, event videographers, promo editors, and film students, can efficiently manage their media assets.One of the key features of Kino AI is its ability to automatically backup files from SD cards to pre-designated locations, compatible with external hard drives and cloud storage solutions. After ensuring the safety of the assets, Kino AI can help in reorganizing the files into a custom folder structure.The AI transcription capability of Kino AI enables it to watch and listen to the footage, and based on its understanding, it can name files by the slate, identify interesting moments, and match scenes to a script. Kino AI also automatically populates metadata into a digital codebook, which can be used in any editing environment and shared across departments.Additionally, the tool offers features like automatic audio-visual sync, sound artifact removal, and proxy file generation through a seamless file browser. It aims to automate mundane, menial, and essential parts of filmmakers' workflows, making it a valuable asset for filmmakers looking to streamline their processes.Although currently in private beta, interested individuals can sign up for early access to experience Kino AI in action.</p>
