            <h2>About Augmend</h2>
            <p>Augmend is an AI-assisted tool designed to facilitate knowledge sharing and expertise scaling within teams. It offers the ability to record screens, in order to document and preserve various processes, technical talks and more. It is created with the aim of minimizing the pain associated with maintaining documentation while promoting faster onboarding. Understanding content is made easier with the tool's built-in chat and AI-generated highlights.In addition, it directly embeds recordings in documentation, wikis, and websites to support team discussions. This feature enables team members to ask questions and get quick answers, which reference the corresponding part in the recording. The answers are pulled from the text on the screen, a transcript of the spoken content, and actions taken during the recording.Augmend provides automatic summaries and chapters, offering an overall view of what the recording contains. Recordings are readily shareable and are designed for one application or many, leveraging the ability for asynchronous pair programming, without the need for complex video editing. It also simplifies the process of sharing, enabling distribution to an individual, a team, or the world at large.Augmend includes a feature that allows users to copy commands, URLs, and more from a recording. This minimizes the need for pausing and rewinding, facilitating knowledge transfer. It also offers auto-generated documentation, creating detailed records from your demonstrated processes or code segments. Demonstrated commands and actions can be converted into documentation, and can be easily embedded with the tool's built-in assistant.</p>
