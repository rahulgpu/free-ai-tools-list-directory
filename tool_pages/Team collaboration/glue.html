            <h2>About Glue</h2>
            <p>Glue is a work chat application designed to facilitate focused, AI-assisted conversations. It combines the functionalities of a regular chat tool with the power of AI, creating a smarter work chat platform that enables integration between people, applications, and AI systems. At the heart of Glue is the Glue AI, an intelligent assistant that can be invoked from any thread, designed to iterate on ideas, provide feedback, and summarise information, leading to more productive conversations. A distinguishing feature is the ability to choose a model to power Glue AI, including offerings from OpenAI or Anthropic, hinting at adaptability and customization. Moreover, glued AI works in unison with the team, offering group benefits. Context is a key component of this tool, as it understands threads and groups and can cross-reference with documents batched with the current thread to provide answers. Another key aspect of this tool is the empowerment of threads, enabling a unique and flexible way of conversation as users can add someone to a single thread, add multiple groups to a thread or reply in a new thread to fork the conversation. Additionally, Glue allows for integrations with several other productivity tools. Finally, Glue provides a platform for developers to integrate their favorite apps and workflows, with a public API and app platform soon to be launched.</p>
