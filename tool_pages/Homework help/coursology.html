            <h2>About Coursology</h2>
            <p>Coursology is an AI-powered educational tool designed to assist students with their academic commitments. The tool offers a variety of features adapted to the educational realm. The principal functionality is the 'AI Homework Helper', aimed at helping students find appropriate solutions to their assignments across a wide range of subjects including Economics, Language, Geometry, Math, Chemistry, Physics, Literature, and History. Coursology also provides a Chrome extension for convenient access to solutions, enhancing understanding and verification of students' homework. Additionally, the tool includes a mobile application with a 'Snap, Solve, Learn' feature where students can take pictures of their questions and get instant AI-generated solutions. Its 'Lecture Listen' feature can transcribe lectures into notes in real-time, aiding the note-taking process. Moreover, the tool facilitates turning study materials into chatbots, practice quizzes and flashcard sets for effective studying. Finally, the 'Coursology Write' feature aids with writing assignments by offering help with writing, citing, and editing. Despite these features, Coursology encourages academic honesty and aims to be a tool for understanding and assistance rather than an avenue for dishonesty.</p>
