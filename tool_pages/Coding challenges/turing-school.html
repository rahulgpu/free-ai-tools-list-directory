            <h2>About Turing.School</h2>
            <p>Turing.School is an AI-boosted exercise platform designed to aid in the learning process for coding. The platform caters to users with varying backgrounds by providing the option to select a story background for the generated exercises. The exercises are created with the aid of chatGPT, reinforcing them with engaging contexts such as horror, sci-fi, or magical backgrounds. Turing.School enables users to design their exercises using keywords and then the AI generates the rest, which could be a zombie apocalypse or a character from a fantasy series encountering a problem that needs to be solved with programming. In response to a specified problem, the students can implement their solutions using Python, as in the featured examples. The platform also offers instructional resources in the form of a Demo Course which helps familiarize users with the course interface and content. Apart from just generating different coding challenges, Turing.School has an AI Tutor available for users who might need further assistance or clarification about the exercises. It breaks down the traditional barriers of waiting times and allows users to get immediate responses to their questions.</p>
