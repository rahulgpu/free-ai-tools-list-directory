            <h2>About ExerDevAI</h2>
            <p>ExerDevAI is a SaaS tool designed to generate customised coding exercises via AI. This tool offers an opportunity to create development exercises tailored to specific criteria, utilising the capabilities of the OpenAI API. The platform enables users to define parameters around the duration of an exercise, with a broad range from a quick 15 minutes to a comprehensive 4 hours. It also allows for the selection of exercise difficulty, catering for varying skill levels from Junior to Expert. Exercises can be designed around several programming languages, including but not limited to PHP, JavaScript, Python, and Java, among others, allowing the user to refine and expand their knowledge in their language of choice. Individual user level is also taken into account, with options ranging from Junior, Intermediate, Senior, to Expert, suggesting that the tool could be a useful resource for a wide range of users, from beginners just starting their coding journey to professionals seeking in-depth challenges. A choice between different versions of the GPT model (GPT-3 Turbo and GPT-4 Turbo) is given, providing an insight into different AI capabilities, and presumably, varying levels and types of coding exercises. For ease and convenience, the tool supports integration with a range of third-party platforms for user login, including Discord, GitHub, GitLab, and Google. Overall, ExerDevAI comes across as a versatile tool, both in terms of the diverse coding exercises it can generate and the wide range of user levels it caters for.</p>
