            <h2>About Unakin</h2>
            <p>Sawyer, built by Unakin, is a revolutionary AI game developer aimed at transforming the game development process by autonomously tackling various engineering tasks. Using advanced reasoning, planning, and tool use capabilities, Sawyer can complete a wide range of tasks, from start to finish, without needing much human intervention. This includes fixing performance issues and iterating on gameplay mechanics. Sawyer can understand the codebase and game project, before generating full solutions to user prompts. This might involve writing its own product specs, creating working code, and making engine manipulations. One of the strengths of Sawyer is its ability to execute complex tasks end-to-end. Sawyer boasts a context engine which allows it to understand the nuances of your code and project. This feature is designed to produce better results through context understanding. An additional feature, Sawyer ensures data privacy and security by not using studio code to retrain general models. The comprehensive functionality of this tool provides autonomous game optimization, assisting developers in improving their game's performance.</p>
