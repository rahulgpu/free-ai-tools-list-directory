It hosts an extensive library of attorney-drafted clauses, which users can leverage for their specific needs, promoting consistency and quality in legal documentation. One of the notable features of Lawformer is its ability to help users craft a personal library of clauses pulled from existing contracts, enhancing manageability and accessibility. This feature allows for swift clause integration into new contracts, which can prove beneficial in contract drafting and management roles. Alongside its main functionalities, Lawformer also presents a learning platform aptly named 'Lawformer Classroom'. This platform aims to enhance users' practical skills in contract drafting.
