The platform also incorporates Certify, a tool that assists in swift contract negotiations, enabling sales teams to conclude deals rapidly by overcoming hurdles in contract discussions. Additionally, reliability and trustworthiness are established via the tool's presence in numerous companies and law firms across the globe, along with its hands-on application in tens of thousands of contract reviews performed monthly. Furthermore, the AI tool's minimum accuracy is listed as 85%, and offers an opportunity to reach a 99% accuracy mark via Verification.
