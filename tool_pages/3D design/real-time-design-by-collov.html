            <h2>About Real-time Design by Collov</h2>
            <p>AI Real-time Design is the first controllable real-time design software powered by artificial intelligence. Its prominent feature is layout control, making it easier for users to modify designs and see their ideas materialize instantly. Users can expect immediate, realistic renderings from sketches and 3D base models. The software also provides precise control over design layouts, enabling the user to match their exact vision. Optimized for a time-saving workflow, it notably reduces rendering times, promoting productivity and faster project completion. AI Real-time Design has a diverse input compatibility feature that allows real-time designing with varied inputs such as sketch-drawings, 3D base models, images, screen sharing, or even live camera. It has a fine-tuned algorithm designed to detect professional design software, offering real-time rendering as users edit their 3D models. The tool includes advanced features such as brushes, pencils, color palette, furniture library and more for precise design modifications. This tool is beneficial for activities such as home redesign, furniture editing, and more.</p>
