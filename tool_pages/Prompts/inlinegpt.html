            <h2>About InlineGPT</h2>
            <p>InlineGPT is an AI-based tool that claims to work across all user applications. It's described as a mechanism to generate prompt anywhere within the user's workspace, acting as an inline chat feature that can be integrated into various applications. The service appears to function universally, offering seamless use from design tools such as Figma to email clients and beyond. The key feature is its accessibility, where it stands at the user's disposal at all times to treat any selected text as a prompt, shift its content and watch as it replaces that text with output results. It operates using an OpenAI API key, suggesting it's powered by OpenAI's language models. However, the exact language model in use isn't explicitly mentioned. It's essential to note that inquiries about its costs, future functionalities, and privacy policies are mentioned but not detailed in the description. The tool implies to target users who require constant context switching between different applications by offering one comprehensive solution to fit all their application needs. It's presented as a free tool but users need to provide their own OpenAI API keys.</p>
