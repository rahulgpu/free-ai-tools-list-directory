            <h2>About PulseMail</h2>
            <p>PulseMail is an AI-driven email assistant designed to streamline communication and improve productivity. It enables intelligent email responses, combined with tailor-made engagements and insightful inbox prioritizing, which form a precise and effective hub for communication. The tool responds to emails on behalf of the user, allowing them to manage their inboxes without needing to manually open every email for review. PulseMail further offers functionalities that recognize meeting requests, displaying the details on the user's dashboard to provide an easy avenue for confirmation, declination, or suggesting alternatives. Responding to emails then becomes automated, simplifying the correspondence process. Another key feature of this tool is the ability to sort and summarize emails based on their importance and relevance. It also provides flexibility in terms of accustoming the tool to the user's needs. Another feature is offering daily statistics and highlighting peak email times, which allows the tool to suggest optimal usage schedules based on this data, thus helping the user utilize the benefits of the tool at their convenience. Other features include a customization function, which adds a unique touch to emails, and analytics, which provide performance insights. PulseMail can be integrated with existing tools to create a cohesive communication ecosystem.</p>
