            <h2>About HomeScore</h2>
            <p>HomeScore is an AI tool designed to assist serious homebuyers to make well-informed and smart decisions in their home purchasing endeavors. It handles the analysis of various documents, reports, images, and even floor plans of potential properties with the goal of matching these against the buyers lifestyle preferences and risk profile. The tool also offers side-by-side comparisons for different properties, taking into account various home systems, lifestyle factors, and action items. HomeScore goes beyond the surface to reveal in-depth insights about properties that may not typically be available with traditional property analysis. It encourages buyers to set their preferences, upload relevant docs and reports to generate personalized home insights which streamlines the purchasing decision. The tool also generates instant cost estimates, identifies potential health hazards, gauges a property's suitability for children or remote work, and offers guidance from property search to final signature. Additionally, it provides resources for sellers and agents to verify property quality. HomeScore also supports real-time collaboration with your spouse or realtor and provides insights on how renovations could potentially add value to the home.</p>
