            <h2>About Pump</h2>
            <p>Pump is an AI-powered cloud savings tool that automatically optimizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) bills without any input from engineers. The tool aims to help businesses save up to 60% on their AWS bills by providing group discounts and using algorithmic arbitrage to match AWS consumption with commitments in real-time. With minimal IAM permissions and operations solely at the billing layer level, Pump claims to ensure maximum security with zero impact on the user's infrastructure. Businesses can get started with Pump for free, with no obligation to commit unless they are satisfied with the cost savings that Pump provides. Pump requires users to commit to working together for a year to balance risks, and monetizes through a small percentage from the volume discounts of the collective spend achieved. Pump supports many AWS services including EC2, Sagemaker, RedShift, ECS, Lambda, EBS, ElasticCache, OpenSearch, and plans to add support for RDS, EC2 Data Transfer, and S3 soon. Pump offers free estimate savings, zero financial risk, and zero engineering effort. Contacting their support team can help answer other questions that may not be listed in the FAQ section on their website. While currently focused only on AWS, Pump plans to add support for GCP and Azure in the future as well.</p>
