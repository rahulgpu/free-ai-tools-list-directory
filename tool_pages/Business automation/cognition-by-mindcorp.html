            <p>Cognition, created by Mindcorp AI, is a professional-grade AI platform designed for knowledge work, specifically in research, analysis, and planning. Rather than functioning as a basic AI chat assistant, Cognition is created to address complex real-world business problems. Its core technology is designed to amplify collective intelligence while enhancing collaboration, automating workflows, improving thinking processes, and providing quality answers. The tool's main aim is to make AI tools more actionable and impactful for businesses. Cognition's functionality disrupts the traditional approaches by cost-effectively increasing productivity and operational efficiencies. It is used across many Fortune 500 companies, assisting teams to enhance their thinking, collaboration, and working practices across various types of knowledge work. Capabilities include but are not limited to research & analysis, strategic planning, problem-solving, design & development, decision-making, ideation & innovation, workflow automation, and project work.Additionally, Cognition utilizes AI-powered virtual professional team-members, known as ACES. Each of these AI agents is specialized in their respective fields and job functions. ACES provide higher-level cognition and behavior abilities such as reasoning, analytics, strategy, and are capable of performing multi-step projects and tasks without being limited to a single model. Cognition allows businesses to tap into the benefits of AI for knowledge work, translating from ideas to actionable insights in quick and responsible ways.
