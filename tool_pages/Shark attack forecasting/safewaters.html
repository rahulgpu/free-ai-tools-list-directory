            <h2>About Safewaters</h2>
            <p>SafeWatersAI is an AI application that uses deep learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to forecast and predict the risk of shark attacks at given times and in certain conditions. With this technology, swimmers, surfers, and beach-goers can assess their risk and either avoid the water that day or take proper precautions. The app will be available for both Android and IOS so users can assess their risk on the go. SafeWatersAI also plans to donate 5% of all profits towards ocean cleanup and conservation efforts, and publish new research efforts and findings made by both other organizations and themselves. They will also be developing and offering an API to access their data and implement it into other IOS/Android applications or websites. While their Kickstarter campaign is currently underway, the app is set to launch in the summer. In a world where the concern about shark attacks is increasing, Safe WatersAI provides users with an opportunity to make informed decisions about their safety while also helping to support ocean conservation efforts.</p>
