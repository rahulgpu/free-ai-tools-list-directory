            <h2>About Scite</h2>
            <p>Scite Assistant is an AI-enabled research tool designed to help you find research-backed answers and collaborate on written materials. The tool provides insights and gives you control over its thought process, allowing for a more customized and interactive experience. You can use Assistant to ask questions and it will provide informed answers using large language models (LLMs) designed specifically for research workflows. Beyond providing answers, Assistant also helps you find supporting and contrasting evidence for your research study. One key feature is the control settings that allow you to steer the Assistant towards specific tasks. For instance, you can let the Assistant decide whether references are needed or override its behavior. You can also specify search filters like year ranges, topics, publication types, or journal names when searching for papers. Moreover, you can instruct the Assistant to use only papers from a specific collection or journals that you are interested in. You can also control the length of the Assistant's responses. The goal of Scite Assistant is to provide an AI-powered research partnership experience that puts the user's needs and preferences at the forefront. In doing so, it offers a unique blend of AI-powered expertise and user-driven customization to optimize research tasks.</p>
