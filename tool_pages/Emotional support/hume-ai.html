            <h2>About Hume AI</h2>
            <p>Hume AI is a unique AI suite designed to measure, comprehend, and enhance the influence of technology on human emotions. The platform features several key capabilities, including an Empathic Voice Interface (EVI): a conversation voice API powered by empathic AI. The EVI is capable of assessing subtle modifications in vocal outputs, steering both language and speech responses. Trained on extensive human interactions, it exemplifies the integration of language modeling and text-to-speech capabilities, supplemented by emotional awareness, prosody, end-of-turn detection, interruptibility, and alignment.Another notable feature of Hume AI is its Expression Measurement API: a tool built on over a decade's worth of research that instantaneously captures the nuances in expressions in audio, video, and images. This includes a range of expressions such as laughter blending with awkwardness, sighs of relief, nostalgic glances, among others.Hume AI also offers a Custom Model API: a low-code customization ability that provides insights for your application. This model implemented transfer learning from their high-performance expression measurement models and empathic large language models (eLLMs), and it is capable of predicting almost any outcome more accurately than with language alone.Regardless of the specialization, Hume AI's focus lies with empathic AI with an emphasis on fostering human well-being. Its commitment to developing empathic technology extends to continuous research in devising foundation models that align with human well-being.</p>
