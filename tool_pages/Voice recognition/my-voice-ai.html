            <h2>About My Voice AI</h2>
            <p>My Voice AI is a conversational AI company that specializes in building secure end-to-end voice intelligence platforms. Their first product, NanoVoiceTM, uses Tiny Machine Learning (tinyML) to verify speakers in real-time, even on ultra-low power edge AI platforms. This patented technology is independent of any language and works in real-world conditions on any device from cloud to mobile phones and even ultra-low powered chips. It provides speaker identification, anti-spoofing, and digit verification by detecting recordings and spoofing attempts, verifying that the right person is saying the random digit passcode. Additionally, the technology also detects emotions like stress, happiness, and anger as well as gender and age through voice only.My Voice AI’s world-class speech scientists are developing the next generation of voice AI innovation beyond identity, with a focus on pure science. The company’s customers include financial institutions and edge AI embedded platform leaders. The company was founded by a team of speech scientists and serial entrepreneurs, including Dr. David Horowitz, Ivar Line, and Nikola Andelic. By leveraging state-of-the-art deep neural network and deep learning techniques, My Voice AI delivers the world’s smallest footprint and power-efficient training and inference engines. Overall, My Voice AI's products aim to enhance the authentication experience and improve the user interface by allowing users to communicate with technology using their voice only.</p>
