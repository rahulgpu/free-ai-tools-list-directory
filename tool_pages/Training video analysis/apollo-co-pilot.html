            <h2>About Apollo Co-Pilot</h2>
            <p>Apollo Co-Pilot is a sport analytics platform that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide coaches and athletes with instant feedback on training videos. It primarily functions by allowing users to record and upload their sports-training videos, post which, AI-driven recommendations are generated. This innovative platform employs a GPT-based AI for the analysis, contributing to an enhanced training experience. As part of its vision, Apollo Co-Pilot aspires to develop a fully AI-assistant platform that facilitates effective interaction between coaches and athletes. This is anticipated to combine AI insights with sports tracking devices into one seamless interface providing real-time data, in-depth performance analytics, and personalized training plans. Such an ecosystem aims at empowering athletes and coaches alike, revolutionizing the current training methodology. Additionally, the platform also sustains a feature for the integration of smart gadgets and the creation of nutritional plans. Coaches interested in joining this platform are welcome to do so, enabling them to contribute their expertise to it. As this tool is currently in its beta testing phase, it may present some restrictions, such as a limited number of API calls per day. Worth noting that the future enhancements of Apollo Co-Pilot include comprehensive real-time feedback on exercise techniques from AI and coaches, personalized training programs, and nutritional plan creation.</p>
