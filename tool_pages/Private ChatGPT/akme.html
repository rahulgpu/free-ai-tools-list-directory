            <h2>About AKME</h2>
            <p>AKME is an iOS application developed to enable efficient interaction with OpenAI's GPT model by way of a chat-like interface. This tool is suitable for diverse use cases with its ample domains and editable prompt suggestions, allowing its users to ask GPT relevant questions based on their distinct needs and interests. Covered domains span across a vast array of topics, from information, education, language learning and personal productivity, to entertainment, career development and fitness among others. The application supports threaded conversations that concentrate on particular topics, as such the message history is sent to GPT, curating coherent and informative dialogues. This application emphasis on user privacy and does not collect user data. As the application interacts with OpenAI's API, the prompts sent by users are not repurposed for further model training. The app also offers customization of GPT parameters such as temperature and topP that allows users to tailor the AI's output to their preference. Additionally, AKME enables users to input their own OpenAI API key or purchase in-app tokens if they don't have such account. Future updates promise expanded domains and prompt suggestions to explore broader interests. Note that AKME is not officially linked with OpenAI.</p>
