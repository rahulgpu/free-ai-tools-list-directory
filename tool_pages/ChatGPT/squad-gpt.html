            <h2>About Squad GPT</h2>
            <p>SquadGPT is a tool that enables teams to chat with the GPT language models developed by OpenAI. It allows users to collaborate and communicate with AI as a team, making it suitable for various situations that involve multiple people working together, such as hiring/interviewing, tutoring, group study, brainstorming, gaming, and problem-solving, and employee onboarding. One of the main features of SquadGPT is its cost control capability. Unlike ChatGPT Plus®, where costs increase with the team size regardless of usage, SquadGPT allows users to AI-enable their team while being able to monitor and control AI costs. This provides businesses with cost visibility, allowing them to compare the cost of AI with the value it brings.Safety and data privacy are prioritized in SquadGPT. Conversations with the AI models are handled through OpenAI's GPT models via their API. OpenAI's policies ensure that they do not access the data submitted using the API. Additionally, SquadGPT aims to enhance control over data access by allowing users to create rules for backend AI models in the future.Although SquadGPT provides access to the standard "System" messages of the AI, customization of AI behavior and preferences is currently limited. However, the tool's developers are actively working to offer finer-grained access to AI-bound messages and expand the range of AI models available for different tasks.Overall, SquadGPT offers a user-friendly interface and aims to provide enterprises with the ability to leverage the power of AI within their teams while maintaining cost control, visibility, and data safety.</p>
