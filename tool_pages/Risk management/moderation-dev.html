            <h2>About Moderation.dev</h2>
            <p>Moderation.dev, also known as Spellbound, is an AI-driven platform dedicated to the development of dynamic, interactive storytelling through the use of conversational AI. It offers a unique experience where users have the opportunity to steer the narrative of the stories according to their preferences. The platform also provides user-tailored guardrails, aimed at managing and mitigating risks within an organizational setting. The principal function of moderation.dev is its ability to identify potential risks through the application of AI and recommend guardrails or protective measures to manage these threats efficiently. This is accomplished by constructing a custom-tailored guardrail model based on users' individual requirements. Additionally, the platform includes a demo feature designed to predict risks associated with AI chatbots that are intended to offer information to website visitors. It builds a model capable of detecting and intercepting questions that a static RAG-based chatbot, trained solely on specific website data, may fail to provide adequate responses to. This advanced prediction and moderation system effectively mitigates the risk of misinformation, ensuring the provision of accurate answers to users. In essence, moderation.dev or Spellbound acts as a multi-dimensional AI platform, striking a balance between engaging storytelling for users and risk management for organizations employing AI tools, particularly chatbots. It offers both an immersive story experience and a robust AI risk mitigation system.</p>
