            <h2>About Fly AI</h2>
            <p>Fly AI is a standalone application designed to bring the robustness of OpenAI's ChatGPT and GPT-4 models to Mac users. Offering a user-friendly design, Fly AI smoothly integrates into the Mac platform, providing swift and efficient access to the AI models' capabilities. Users can create collections of custom AI mini-apps that can be conveniently launched from anywhere within the Mac operating environment. Fly AI helps generate more context-aware results by supporting the saving of frequently utilized prompts and job-specific facts. This time-saving tool is both fast and lightweight, as it is a native Mac application that stays ready for use without the need to open a browser or wait for a webpage to load. Another key value proposition is its privacy-focused design, as user data is not recorded and is in line with OpenAI's API policies, opting out of future model training and being deleted after 30 days. The application supports the use of both ChatGPT and GPT-4, and does not require users to have an OpenAI key or a ChatGPT subscription, but has its own subscription tiers. Fly AI is not an electron application but is 100% native and built with Swift for optimal performance on MacOS. It's crucial to note that while Fly AI significantly utilizes OpenAI's models, it is an independent application not affiliated with OpenAI.</p>
