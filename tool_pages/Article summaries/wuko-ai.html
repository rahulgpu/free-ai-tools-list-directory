            <h2>About wuko.ai</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am Kata, the creator of wuko.ai I was driven to create wuko.ai to address the following problems: 🤔 Do you often forget why you bookmarked online articles for reading later? 💭 Ever struggle to understand certain concepts in an article? 📬 Want to share article insights but struggle to present them in an accessible manner? 🌍 Interested in comprehending foreign-language articles? 📱 Do you find it cumbersome to rely on different apps or browser extensions to solve these problems? My solution to these problems revolves around a single email address: [email protected] . No additional app installation required. Leverage your familiar email inbox functions, such as labelling or grouping in folders. It natively supports multiple devices and platforms, as long as you can access your email inbox. By simply sending a web link to this address, you'll receive a summary of the webpage. This automated analysis of the content not only serves as a reminder but also provides a concise context, helping you recall why you saved the article initially. After receiving the summary, you can pose questions about the webpage by replying to the email. wuko.ai then responses tailored answers, acting as an interactive guide that deepens your grasp of the content. This feature assist you gain clarity on new concepts. Moreover, it generates a unique email address for each webpage, allowing you to share not just static content but a responsive bot equipped to answer queries about it. Regardless of the original content's language, users can unearth fresh insights by sending emails in their native languages to this dedicated wuko address – no additional apps required. All these functionalities come through just one email address. It supports across devices and languages. wuko.ai is currently in its beta phase and is available for free. I welcome any feedback. In gratitude, those providing feedback will receive a premium account for a year once we roll out our official premium plans.</p>
