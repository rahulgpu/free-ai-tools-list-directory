            <h2>About Landing AI</h2>
            <p>Landing AI is a website builder tool that creates a unique landing page with the help of generative Artificial Intelligence in just a few seconds. The tool offers 29 different themes that can reflect a user's branding, and it generates copywriting, color boards, logos, and illustrations that match the theme. The user inputs their project details, including product, market, and customers, and the AI uses this data to create the ideal sales pitch. Once the user chooses the branding theme, they receive three variations of the landing page, each with unique copy, logo, and illustrations. The user can export all the code, text, and images with just one click.Landing AI is suitable for those who want a unique and standout website with copywriting that sells and who want to grow their project instead of spending time on development. However, it is not for those who are seeking a hosting solution or those who have a specific design in mind or require more than a landing page.The pricing for Landing AI is a one-time payment of $19 for one website with three variations, one template, three unique logos, nine unique illustrations, and three website copywritings. The user has complete ownership of the assets, including commercial rights, and can even resell them if they wish.Overall, Landing AI is an AI-driven website builder tool that can quickly generate a unique landing page with branding, copywriting, logos, and illustrations that match the user's input.</p>
