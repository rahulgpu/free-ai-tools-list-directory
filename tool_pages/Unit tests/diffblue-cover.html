            <h2>About Diffblue Cover</h2>
            <p>Diffblue Cover is a tool that leverages autonomous AI to automate unit testing, specifically for Java development teams. This tool is designed to enhance productivity by writing unit tests fully autonomously, freeing developers to focus on more creative tasks. It's capable of writing tests for large legacy codebases and can also assist in identifying untestable code that needs to be refactored. Additionally, the tool supports the transition of migrating an application to the cloud by ensuring the code to be migrated is thoroughly tested. Through its risk reporting dashboard, Diffblue Cover seeks to make agile planning more effective. Its AI-powered platform eliminates the repetitive and tedious task of writing and maintaining unit tests, thus allowing developers to concentrate on writing quality code. Furthermore, the software supports the goal of achieving continuous integration and it can autonomously maintain the test suite as the code is refactored and updated. The objective is to increase the deployment frequency and improve the software delivery process, while also reducing any potential risk associated with application modernization.</p>
