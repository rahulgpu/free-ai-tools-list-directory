            <h2>About BrainStory</h2>
            <p>Brainstory is a collaborative productivity tool designed to facilitate idea discussion. It aims to help users clarify their thoughts and receive feedback from others. The tool guides the conversation by asking follow-up questions and ensures that key points are addressed and not overlooked. After brainstorming, Brainstory provides a cohesive outline of the ideas discussed. The tool supports branching the train of thought into multiple discrete ideas, allowing for iterative thinking and exploration. One of Brainstory's key features is its mobile-friendliness, as it can be accessed on Safari, Chrome, or Firefox on any mobile device without the need for an app installation. Privacy is a priority for Brainstory, as it does not save any personally identifiable information and does not use user data to train models. The tool offers a free trial, allowing users to participate in 10 brainstorming sessions. For continued use, Brainstory provides a simple and transparent pricing model with a monthly subscription fee of $8. By using Brainstory, teams can improve their communication and enhance the brainstorming process. Some frequently asked questions addressed on the platform include whether others need an account to provide feedback, whether Brainstory utilizes Generative AI, the number of free ideas allowed, and whether the subscription can be canceled at any time. Brainstory is committed to enabling smarter thinking and fostering collaboration among users as they work through their ideas.</p>
