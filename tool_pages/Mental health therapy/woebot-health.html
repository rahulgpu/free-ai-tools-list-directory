            <h2>About Woebot Health</h2>
            <p>Woebot Health is an AI-powered, chat-based mental health support platform designed for enterprises. It aims to provide instant, scalable mental health support to patients and members, primarily through an evidence-based digital companion called Woebot. Woebot is based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy concepts and uses rules-based conversations written by conversational writers trained in evidence-based approaches like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and woebot's conversations are guided by clinical experts. Being a relational agent, Woebot establishes a bond with users comparable to human therapists. The platform aids in enhancing the care experience, supports improvement in population health, and aids in increasing provider efficiency by automating the collection of population insights. Additionally, the platform plays a role in identifying individuals needing care and increases capacity beyond traditional clinical settings. It is informed by interventional scientists, and clinicians, and is backed by multiple Randomized Control Trials. The Enterprise configuration of Woebot Health helps deliver a personalized experience to keep members or patients engaged and provides insights into patient and member populations.</p>
