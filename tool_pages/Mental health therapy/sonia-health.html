            <h2>About Sonia Health</h2>
            <p>Sonia is an AI-powered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) tool designed to make mental health care accessible and convenient. As a fully automated AI application, Sonia seeks to emulate the standard conversational therapy session, but provides it through a user's phone, creating an engaging interaction with a virtual empathic voice. Sonia offers therapy sessions which can be communicated via voice or text, making it a versatile platform for different user preferences. One of Sonia's core values is inclusivity in mental health care, aiming to overcome barriers like geographical distance, high costs and social stigma that traditionally hinder access to therapy. With its digital nature, Sonia is conveniently accessible to anyone with an internet connection, it effectively relinquishes the limitations of physical locations and working hours of traditional therapists. Sonia allows users to conduct voice therapy sessions from the privacy of their homes, or text sessions on-the-go, offering its services round the clock. Its main goal is to make therapy more accessible, addressing a significant need in areas with low numbers of mental health professionals. Moreover, Sonia aims to reduce the wait time associated with booking therapy appointments in the traditional setting, offering a quick starting session accessible via its mobile application.</p>
