            <h2>About Unspam</h2>
            <p>Unspam is an AI-powered tool designed to streamline your inbox by filtering out unsolicited emails. The application is compatible with Gmail and Google Workspace, utilizing advanced artificial intelligence to identify and handle spam effectively. Upon connecting your account, the system scans new emails for potential spam which are then labeled or archived automatically, resulting in a clutter-free inbox. User convenience and security is at the core of Unspam. The tool is privacy-focused and is built with strict privacy provisions, ensuring no email storage or logging. Emails are never used to train the AI filter unless manually forwarded to Unspam for training. Although the tool was initially created as a personal solution for the founder and fellow entrepreneurs to deal with unsolicited messages, it has since been shared with a broader audience. The overarching goal of Unspam is to empower users to refocus on what truly matters by minimizing email disruptions.</p>
