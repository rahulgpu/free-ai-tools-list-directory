            <p>RAFA is a financial AI tool designed to provide wealth-building opportunities powered by artificial intelligence. The system continuously analyzes millions of data points to identify potential investment opportunities, aiming to ensure users do not miss out on these. RAFA is constructed around a team of AI agents that contribute their analytical capabilities towards wealth creation. The tool also generates portfolio alerts, providing insights into bullish, bearish, or hedge occurrences, which can help manage risk, by indicating potential downside risk. Investors are able to test the system through a 'Try RAFA' feature, possibly for a trial period. User reviews suggest it can simplify the investment process by conducting the otherwise time-consuming task of technical analysis and identifying new stock purchase opportunities. It is designed to help users make swift and informed investment decisions, reducing the chance of missing profitable opportunities. The tool is marketed towards all types of users, from beginners in investing to more seasoned traders. RAFA appears to be supported by multiple brokerages.</p>
