            <h2>About Passarel</h2>
            <p>Passarel is an AI tool designed to streamline the onboarding process for new employees. By leveraging custom language models and domain-specific data, Passarel enables organizations to create personalized onboarding experiences for their hires. With Passarel, new employees always have access to an onboarding buddy, available round the clock.One of the key features of Passarel is its ability to integrate with existing documentation and knowledge bases, allowing organizations to build bespoke GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)-like models for onboarding. This flexibility extends to selectively fine-tuning the integrations and material that constitute the unique AI model.Data security is a priority for Passarel. The tool does not retain any uploaded documents or data once the model is created. All processed information and uploaded documents are permanently erased from storage. This ensures the privacy and safety of sensitive company information.Once the AI model is developed, organizations can deploy it as a bot on popular chat platforms such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, or as an independent chatbox within their own dashboard. This deployment enables employees to access on-demand knowledge conveniently, directly from these platforms.Passarel aims to provide an effortless and effective onboarding experience for organizations by leveraging the power of AI and tailored language models. By automating the onboarding process, organizations can save time and ensure consistent and personalized support for new hires.</p>
