            <h2>About Doctalyzer</h2>
            <p>Doctalyzer is a tool that addresses the gap in understanding medical reports in common language. This AI-driven platform assists users by analyzing and interpreting their medical reports into more simplified terms that can be easily understood by laypersons. Functionality of interest includes a 'Report Analyzer' and a 'Medicine Analyzer'. The Report Analyzer helps break down complex medical jargon, diagnoses, or results found in medical reports into more accessible language. Similarly, the Medicine Analyzer provides interpretations of medicines, possibly including their effects, uses or precautions in layman terms. This tool is intended to your enhance grasp over medical information instead of replacing professional medical advice. It is important to note that while the AI makes sense of technical data, it does not provide a diagnosis or treatment plan. It's a valuable asset for those wanting a better understanding of their health, helping to bridge the gap between medical practitioners and patients. Developed by Team Paradox, the team appears to value building user-friendly, beneficial tools. Yet, always consult your healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.</p>
