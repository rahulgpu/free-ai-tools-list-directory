            <h2>About Send AI</h2>
            <p>Send AI provides a document processing infrastructure that aims to streamline business workflow by automating document management tasks. The platform has capabilities to parse, classify, extract, validate, and export data from documents. Users can train and configure their own AI models using Send AI's systems to extract information from documents and export it directly into their own systems. To ensure accuracy, it allows users to apply custom validation logic in the process. The tool supports Optical Character Recognition (OCR) which transforms scanned images into readable text while retaining the original structure. Data extraction using a custom language model trained on a small set is also offered, ensuring high accuracy of extracted entities. A unique feature included in the toolset is model training, which allows users to tailor language models to their specific needs and use cases. This model training feature enables the recognition and extraction of specific entities from documents. Data export is optimised for user preferences, ensuring that exported entities match given data types with a validation feature called Type Checking. Send AI allows users to stay in control of exported data through an easy-to-use interface, providing options for quick corrections and edits. The system learns from user's feedback resulting in continuous improvement of data exports. It's designed to work across multiple sectors including Insurance, Retail, Transport & Logistics, and Government. Data security standards are prioritised, offering features like encryption, single-tenant storage, adherence to GDPR, and ISO/SOC2 infrastructure.</p>
