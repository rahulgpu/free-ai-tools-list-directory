            <h2>About Sunflower Sparrow</h2>
            <p>Sunflower Sparrow is an AI tool by Sunflower Industries built with the purpose of transforming vocals into Artificial Intelligence (AI) voices in a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) with near-real time playback. The tool offers unlimited voice conversions, that is important for users who require expansive conversions. Additionally, these conversions are royalty-free, cleared for commercial use. An interesting feature provided by Sunflower Sparrow is that you can load custom models in their standard format. This allows users to add their models, even from external community sources. The tool also facilitates modifications of the character of your voice, auditioning a singer when they are not available, or even creating entirely new voices. Sunflower Sparrow supports VST & AU plugins and is available for download on M1 Macs. It intends to extend its support to Windows platform in future. Plans are also in works to grant users the ability to train AI on their own voices. The tool's performance mode aims to reduce latency even further in order to provide a smoother user experience. The tool is built with the vision of enabling new modes of musical expression for both new and experienced users, while promoting ethical usage. This reflects the mission of Sunflower Industries to harness technology in creating cutting-edge musical tools.</p>
