The technology, with its natural and never robotic nuance, captures and replicates every emotion and detail from the original speech pattern.The tool offers a wide range of applications that include cloning voices for films, TV shows, commercials, and digital ads, creating entire worlds through animation, replicating the perfect voice for podcasts, audiobooks, and dubbing and localization projects. Respeecher provides a support program for small content creators who need its technology but are low on budget. The software ensures creative control for content creators with easy changeability deep into the creative process without the hassle of rerecording the original voice. Respeecher's voice cloning technology has been used by popular brands such as Lucasfilm, Sony, Deezer, and Digital Domain, among others.
