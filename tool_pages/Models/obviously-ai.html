            <h2>About Obviously AI</h2>
            <p>Obviously AI is a no-code tool designed to simplify the process of data science. It packs in the functionalities of machine learning model building, explaining results, and predicting outcomes, all within a single interface. Models can be built and deployed directly from the platform in minutes, saving considerable time compared to traditional coding methods. It supports various forms of prediction including classification for factors such as churn, lead conversion, and loan repayment, regression for outcomes like sales, dynamic pricing, and yield, and time series for predicting quantities over time such as sales in the coming months or stock prices. The tool's features extend beyond model building. It enables quick deployment of AI models, real-time API integration for making predictions on the fly in apps, visualization of prediction data in other tools like PowerBI or Looker, automated model monitoring, and powerful process automation capabilities via Zapier. The software also includes the support of a dedicated data science expert to assist with team needs such as data merging, enrichment, cleaning and other statistical tasks. Furthermore, users can integrate Obviously AI with other tools such as Zapier, Airtable, Dropbox, and Salesforce to enhance their services.</p>
