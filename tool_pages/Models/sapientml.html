            <h2>About SapientML</h2>
            <p>SapientML is an AutoML technology designed to streamline the process of generating high-quality pipelines for predictive tasks on new datasets. It achieves this by learning from a corpus of existing datasets and their human-written pipelines. Key features of SapientML include high speed, transparency, and high accuracy. The tool is capable of quickly generating AI models by evaluating the most plausible machine learning pipelines, instead of all possible combinations. This results in faster model creation. Additionally, the generated machine learning program contains explanations that make it easy to understand how the AI model was built.SapientML also excels in accuracy by leveraging past knowledge of programs used to build highly accurate AI models. By utilizing this knowledge, it is able to generate highly accurate AI models that deliver reliable predictions.To get started with SapientML, users are instructed to install the tool by running "pip install sapientml" and then utilize the provided APIs to generate machine learning pipelines. Further guidance and details can be found in the "Getting Started" section of the official documentation.The paper titled "SapientML: Synthesizing Machine Learning Pipelines by Learning from Human-Written Solutions," presented at the 44th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2022), serves as a reference for SapientML. The tool is available on GitHub for developers to explore and contribute.</p>
