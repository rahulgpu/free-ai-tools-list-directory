            <h2>About QuestionAid</h2>
            <p>QuestionAid is an innovative AI-powered tool designed to generate questions from any given text. It provides an efficient means for teachers, educators and trainers to create quizzes or tests with relative ease. The tool not only generates questions based on the text, but it also generates distractors which are wrong answers used in multiple choice questions. This can be useful in creating more challenging and differentiating multiple choice tests. Along with these functionalities, QuestionAid also offers the convenience of exporting these generated questions to various Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Moodle and Kahoot. The offering of the tool is flexible to match users' needs, allowing them to purchase credits as required, rather than following a subscription-based model. It should be noted that the number of questions or distractors that can be generated is based on the number of credits purchased. Taking into consideration its capabilities and features, QuestionAid can be a valuable asset for educators in creating comprehensive quizzes and tests with reduced effort and increased efficiency.</p>
