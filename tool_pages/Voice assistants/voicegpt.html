            <h2>About VoiceGPT</h2>
            <p>VoiceGPT is a voice assistant and chatbot app that provides users with a voice-interactive platform to engage with AI models like ChatGPT. Its utility extends not just as a verbal assistant, but also as an Android browser with a voice extension that enhances accessibility to AI engines. The platform is designed to assist users with visual impairments, dyslexia, and other conditions, making AI interaction more user-friendly and manageable. With voice input and spoken output, users can communicate with the AI models seamlessly. The app also offers optical character recognition (OCR) support, enabling uploading and processing of text from images. Key features include unlimited free messages, voice input/output in multiple languages, option to set VoiceGPT as default assistant, and hands-free activation via a hotword. The application has functionalities like the instabubble feature for effortless app switching, predefined prompts for specific interactions, integration of multiple programming languages with an inbuilt code editor, and conversation history access. It also supports ChatGPT Plus accounts and related features. Another significant element is the DALLE-2 integration that allows users to create images within the application. The application is designed to work effectively on tablets and provides landscape mode for better user experience. Other features include adjustable themes, a detailed changelog, auto-refresh of dialogues when ChatGPT servers are busy, prompts for new updates on Google Play, and minimal advertisements. Note that VoiceGPT, despite its advanced capabilities, is not a standalone AI model or chatbot and is not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenAI or any other AI company.</p>
