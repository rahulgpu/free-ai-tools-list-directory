            <h2>About Icetana</h2>
            <p>icetana is an AI security video analytics software that enhances the active monitoring of security surveillance networks. It utilizes AI-based video anomaly detection and analytics to detect unusual or interesting events across large surveillance networks.The software addresses the challenge faced by security professionals who are often overwhelmed by the sheer amount of CCTV video footage generated daily. Security teams are often stuck in the endless cycle of watching monitors, which can lead to missed security issues. Additionally, technology for simple object detection is inadequate for real-time events.icetana offers a solution by training cameras to detect unusual events and behavior, allowing security teams to recognize and act on potential security issues before they happen. The software continuously learns about each environment, improving its detection capabilities over time without the need for constant rule defining or modification.With icetana, security teams experience better outcomes for both the people in front of the cameras and those working behind them. The software automatically flags and saves detected anomaly events for review, reducing screen fatigue for security staff. It seamlessly connects to existing systems and is compatible with widely used video surveillance platforms.The software operates in a simple three-step process, where it learns what is normal for the environment, displays only unusual events or events of interest, and improves its detection capabilities over time. By focusing on relevant data, icetana enables security teams to make better real-time decisions.icetana has received positive feedback from customers, with significant improvements in situational awareness and efficiency reported. It offers a no-rule, low-intervention approach, making it user-friendly and efficient for security professionals.</p>
