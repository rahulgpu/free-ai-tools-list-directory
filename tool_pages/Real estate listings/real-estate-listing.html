            <h2>About Real Estate Listing</h2>
            <p>My Real Estate Brochure - AI is an AI-powered tool that creates custom real estate brochures within minutes by answering just 10 questions. The tool creates a fully-tailored and creative sales brochure with four different slides within a beautifully designed template. The system generates written text modules and three design templates to choose from, making it easier for real estate agents to create high-quality brochures quickly. The custom-made real estate brochure increases the chances of receiving 10x more inquiries and selling properties faster. The listing is in PDF format and designed with modern templates, and customers can edit the entire listing as a Canva template. The tool is ideal for real estate agents and developers who need to create several listings per day as it saves up to three hours of time. The tool's pricing is $25 for a single, one-time payment, with no subscription required. The process involves answering ten questions about the property type, preferred mode of sale (for rent or for sale), number of rooms, presence of car garage, and private parking space, their city, distance to the next supermarket, and five to ten highlights of the object. The custom real estate listing deck is 100% original and written by AI, tailored specifically for each object a customer wants to list in the market. The tool is convenient and efficient, as it enables real estate agents to create high-quality brochures in 10 minutes, reducing the time taken to create brochures manually. The tool allows real estate agents to devote more time to other critical aspects of their work, such as marketing and property viewings.</p>
