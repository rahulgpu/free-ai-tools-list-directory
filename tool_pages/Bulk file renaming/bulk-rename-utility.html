            <h2>About Bulk Rename Utility</h2>
            <p>Bulk Rename Utility is a comprehensive online tool designed to streamline the process of renaming files in bulk. The utility operates on the web and is compatible with Windows and Mac systems through Chrome and Edge browsers. It is especially favorable for users who seek to rename files without any need to upload them or install additional software.The utility provides two main modes of operation: AI Mode and Rule Mode. In AI Mode, users describe their renaming requirements and the AI generates new file names accordingly. Conversely, the Rule Mode allows for a more custom approach, permitting users to employ a range of rules such as character deletion/replacement, sequence padding, new naming conventions, regular expression replacements, and even layout advanced renames using custom JavaScript functions.The tool includes features designed with user convenience in mind. Without uploading files on the web, Bulk Rename Utility reads only the file's directory, name, and size information. This local operation supports user privacy. Users can easily navigate the tool's features thanks to its intuitive interface. The interface stands out for allowing both AI and rule-based operations to be conducted smoothly and efficiently. Moreover, Bulk Rename Utility is distinctive for integrating different types of renaming rules, ranging from simple character alterations to more complex JavaScript functions and regular expressions. While the tool particularly favors Chrome and Edge browsers, it remains an efficient, user-friendly, and trustworthy option for renaming files on both Windows and Mac platforms.</p>
