            <h2>About Journey AI by TheyDo</h2>
            <p>Journey AI is a sophisticated tool designed to swiftly convert customer research into actionable journey maps, facilitating more effective decision-making. With its ability to significantly minimize the time taken for journey mapping, it enhances productivity and allows for a stronger focus on delivering excellent customer experiences. Journey AI utilizes text-based research, ranging from sticky notes to surveys, to create unbiased journey maps driven directly by customer feedback. As a result, this program aids in contextualizing broad customer research quickly and efficiently, enabling decisions that put customer insights at the forefront. Key functionalities include the option for importing customer interactions for custom journey map creation, maintaining up-to-date maps with real-time data, and an 'Opportunity Reveal' feature that examines insights and identifies high impact opportunities. Upload your customer research, and Journey AI will extract key insights, map them into a journey that is consistently updated as further research is added. This tool also sorts insights into 'Needs', 'Pains', 'Gains', and 'Observations'. It features a review stage where insights are examined before they're integrated and allows the distinction of AI-generated insights. It additionally identifies problem areas in customer journeys that have a high potential for business impact. All of your customer data is private, secure, and never used to train models. The technology uses a mix of open-source and third-party models, principally provided by OpenAI, and all data is stored on a private cloud.</p>
