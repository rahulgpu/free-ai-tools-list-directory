            <h2>About Cara by Webtastic AI</h2>
            <p>Cara searches LinkedIn, Apollo and 50 more data sources for ICP leads in buying mode. Next she uses ChatGPT to write hyper personalized emails. Next she uses your gMail or Outlook account to send them emails. Employ Cara in three steps. 1. Hire. Tell Cara about your business, your ideal customer profile, and your preferred communication style. 2. Train. Work with Cara by reviewing the leads she finds and the outbound messaging she ghostwrites for you. Once you're on the same page, you can ask her to work autonomously. 3. Convert. Cara learns from every interaction, making your campaigns not only generate more meetings, but also the right ones, at scale. Cara sends the right message, to the right person, at the right time, on autopilot. Cara automates your outbound sales process, from researching and identifying the right people, to ghostwriting the highest-converting 1:1 personalized outbound messages, sent at the right time. 1. Prospecting. Cara scans over 50 B2B data sources (eg. Apollo, Hunter, LinkedIn) to help you find ICP leads in buying mode. She has access to over 275M people. 2. Research. Next, Cara conducts detailed research on prospects she found for you and triple-verifies the contact details. 3. Outreach. Cara ghostwrites 1:1 hyper-personalized messages for each prospect and sends them at the time they are most likely to engage. 4. Autopilot. Once trained and switched to autonomous mode, Cara consistently works 24/7, meeting the sales quota set by you. Cara accesses all the data in one consolidated place. 1. Data Aggregation. Cara works with Webtastic AI Nexus, which autonomously indexes web data, social media, news, interviews, and podcasts, and integrates with over 50 B2B data providers, including LinkedIn, Apollo, and Google. 2. Single Subscription. With Cara accessing the precise data you need, there's no need for subscriptions to multiple costly data providers or worries about missing out on any other tools.</p>
