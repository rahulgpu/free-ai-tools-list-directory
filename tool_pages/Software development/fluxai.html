            <h2>About FluxAI</h2>
            <p>Flux presents a novel approach to building Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) for hardware engineers. It reduces much of the busy work typically associated with the task and keeps the team synchronized. Flux is aided by its AI tool, Copilot, specially designed to accelerate the PCB building process. Functions of Copilot range from brainstorming solutions, making connections in a schematic design, to answering contextual questions about a particular component. Additionally, Flux offers features aimed at expediting the design process and reducing redundancy. These include allowing parametric design for systemic layout edits, having automated impedance control for calculations, and providing access to real-time pricing and availability from major distributors like Digi-Key, Mouser, and LCSC. For starting new projects, Flux provides a comprehensive and easy-to-use library, filled with reusable components, projects, and templates that eliminate the need to recreate frequently-used parts. The cloud-based library management negates the need for time-consuming syncs and updates. Moreover, Flux also streamlines the design review process by providing an easily accessible platform for collaboration and feedback, akin to how Google Docs functions. Users can grant permissions, capture comments, and engage in asynchronous reviews with their fellow collaborators. The platform can even be accessed via a browser or mobile device without any need for downloads.Flux also offers reusable blocks, integrated simulators, and scripting facilities to guide engineers from the ideation phase to prototype creation effectively and efficiently. An added advantage is the option of choosing specific parts later in the design process, reducing early stage complications. Overall, Flux is a holistic, AI-powered solution known for its efficient handling of PCB manufacturing processes, from designing and reviewing to the selection and management of components.</p>
