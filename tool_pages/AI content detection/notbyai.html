            <h2>About Notbyai</h2>
            <p>The Not By AI Badge is a tool to help content creators indicate that their work is not generated by AI. The badge is designed to encourage humans to continue creating original content and to help users identify human-generated content. Considering that AI is trained on human-generated content, relying solely on AI could result in repetitive and stagnant content. To use the badge, content creators such as writers, researchers, artists, music producers, sound designers, or filmmakers, estimate that at least 90% of their content is created by humans. If the content includes AI, it can only be used for inspiration purposes or to look for grammatical errors and typos. The tool comes with three different badges: Painted By Human, Written By Human, and Produced By Human. Content creators can choose the badge that best represents their work based on the type of content they produce. The badges cannot be altered, and minimum size requirements must be respected to maintain legibility. Displaying the badge does not mean the content is not majorly created by AI, and there is no legal significance to its use. The Not By AI badge is not designed to discourage the use of AI but to ensure that humanity continues to advance by creating original content.</p>
