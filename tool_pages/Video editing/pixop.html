            <h2>About Pixop</h2>
            <p>Pixop is an AI and ML powered cloud-based video enhancement, remastering and upscaling service. It helps professionals, filmmakers, video editors, post producers and video production companies improve the quality and resolution of their footage at the touch of a button without the need for expensive hardware or complicated setups. It offers a range of powerful automated filters for ML super resolution, AI denoising, AI deinterlacing, AI deep restoration and more, all trained on thousands of hours of footage and tested rigorously. Its web app is an intuitive and affordable way for users to access the service, with no downloads, expensive hardware or specialized knowledge required. It also offers a REST API for clients with larger archives, designed for high-volume integration scenarios. Plus, Pixop partners with video delivery and service providers to create a value-added service by integrating its video enhancement and upscaling tools into existing infrastructure and workflows. Pixop is cloud-based, meaning there are no downloads or expensive hardware required, and all data is encrypted at every stage of the process including encryption in transit inside AWS infrastructure. Payments are also processed securely through Stripe. Clients can use a calculator to get a general idea of how much it costs to process footage, and Pixop offers bulk discounts, custom pricing and REST API access for enterprise clients.</p>
