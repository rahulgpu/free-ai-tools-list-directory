            <h2>About Mailyser</h2>
            <p>Mailyser is a tool powered by artificial intelligence designed to enhance email deliverability and the reputation of email domains. The system primarily ensures that emails reach the primary inbox of the recipient rather than the spam folder. The tool is equipped to monitor the placement of emails in the inbox and the sender's reputation. It provides an alert if your emails are being classified as spam and offers insights into reasons for this as well as suggests solutions to rectify the issue. Mailyser provides features such as Inbox Placement Insights, Sender Reputation Scoring, Sender Infrastructure Monitoring, and testing emails before sending for higher deliverability. The tool also assists in analyzing email content to maximize value, where its content algorithm evaluates the performance of the content for better inbox placement and engagement. It also suggests modifications in the email content to increase its deliverability. Mailyser goes beyond the traditional approach by analyzing mail servers, IP addresses, back-end configurations, and online databases to provide an actionable delivery score. The platform is designed to support any email address for sending campaigns, making it versatile for both personal servers to larger entities.</p>
