            <h2>About AweMyFace</h2>
            <p>AweMyFace is an AI-empowered skincare application designed to guide individuals towards improving their skin health particularly acne-related issues. Through a user-friendly interface, the application uses artificial intelligence to identify and assess acne by analyzing facial zones captured in photos. Tiny changes that are usually missed by the naked eye are picked up, and constant tracking enables a clear picture of any developments. It encourages users to track various factors that can impact skin health including food intake, sleep patterns, stress levels, and exercise habits. The application also provides personalized recommendations based on the user's skin condition and daily routines, helping them to understand the relationship between their lifestyle choices and skin health. Features include progress trackers that show daily, weekly, and monthly skin improvements, helpful articles, and reminders for skincare routines such as cleansing and moisturizing. All features, including acne tracking and daily quiz, operate offline, ensuring accessibility without internet connection. However, AweMyFace values user privacy and all photos and data are stored solely on the user's device without any third-party sharing.</p>
