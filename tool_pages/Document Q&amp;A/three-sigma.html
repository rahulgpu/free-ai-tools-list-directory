            <h2>About Three Sigma</h2>
            <p>Three Sigma is an AI research tool that uses advanced search algorithms to locate the information you need quickly and easily. It is designed to help you enhance productivity, improve efficiency, and innovate in new ways by leveraging OpenAI's algorithms. With Three Sigma, you can cut the time spent reading documents by 90%, making it an ideal assistant to answer any question in your documents. One of the key features of Three Sigma is its ability to trace the exact origin of your answers. Every time you ask a question, the tool shows you how it arrived at the answer. This feature helps to eliminate the black boxes often associated with AI tools. Three Sigma also offers a free Solo Mode that allows you to start a thread and ask questions without referencing any document. Additionally, the tool is continually refining its algorithms by parsing millions of pages, making it an industry-leading algorithm for locating information. Lastly, Three Sigma's upcoming upgrade with GPT-4 will enable the AI to understand the images in your documents, opening up entirely new use cases. While the tool is marketed towards research and AI developers, anyone looking for a quick and efficient way to analyze large amounts of data can benefit from using Three Sigma.</p>
