            <h2>About Ribbo</h2>
            <p>Ribbo is an AI customer support tool designed for businesses of all sizes. Its core proposition is to handle a substantial volume of customer service inquiries by generating a tailored chatbot, trained using a business's data. Ribbo learns from various data sources such as website content, blog posts, documentation, and historical customer support logs to create this bespoke AI chatbot. Ribbo AI extends the capabilities of ChatGPT technology by incorporating a business's unique tone of voice into its interactions with customers, further enhancing its utility. Users can customize all aspects of the chatbot, from design to speech tone, to align it with their brand image. It also supports fine-tuning through a complete chat history, enabling users to correct any inaccurate responses so future similar queries are handled correctly. The tool supports multilingual communication, too. An added feature of Ribbo is the seamless handoff from the bot conversation to a live operator when needed. Ribbo can be easily integrated on a business's website as a live chat widget. The product has been developed with a focus on user-friendliness and does not require sophisticated coding skills to set up.</p>
