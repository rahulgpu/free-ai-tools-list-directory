            <h2>About AnyQuestions</h2>
            <p>AnyQuestions.ai is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that allows users to ask questions about their documents and videos and receive accurate answers that cite the source. It works by extracting text from documents and videos and then using natural language processing (NLP) to provide answers. It is built on the Revision.ai engine, which is trusted by students for its accuracy.AnyQuestions.ai is designed to save users time by providing accurate answers quickly. It supports multiple file types such as PDFs, videos and web pages, and can generate flashcards from documents. It also stores text, embeddings and meta data, but not the files themselves. It is compliant with GDPR, DPA 2018 and ISO 27001.The tool also provides tailored learning maps which enable users to visualise, explore and level up their studies. Additionally, it highlights knowledge gaps to help users understand where their knowledge is lacking. Users can sign up for a free trial to upload three documents and experience the power of AnyQuestions.ai. The Pro and Enterprise plans are also available for more advanced features such as co-worker sharing, use on chats and up to 3000 pages per upload.</p>
