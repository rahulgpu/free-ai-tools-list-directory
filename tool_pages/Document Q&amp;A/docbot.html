            <h2>About docbot</h2>
            <p>docbot is an AI tool designed to foster interaction with documents. It works by building a bot equipped with knowledge obtained from uploaded documents, shared websites, or additional text. It supports various document formats and aims to provide a collaborative and mobile-friendly experience. Users can construct multiple bots, each containing its own knowledge base and can be shared with friends, family or the public. docbot also enables learning from multiple forms of documents, such as photographs of documents, uploaded files, or public websites. The platform is based on a mobile-first user interface, eliminating the need for software installation and enabling document addition and question posing on the go. Its features include using GPT-4o to allow for natural language queries and intuitive additions to the bot's knowledge. The platform also ensures security by encrypting all document data and queries both in transit and at rest, and sharing is strictly limited to those granted access by the bot creator. Supported document formats range from images and PDFs to word documents, slideshows, and e-books, and extend to various text formats, including free form, JSON, and CSV.</p>
