            <h2>About Vectorizer</h2>
            <p>Vectorizer.AI is a tool designed to facilitate the smooth conversion of pixel-based (raster) PNG and JPG images into scalable vector graphics (SVGs) fully automatically. Built on a foundation of deep learning and classical algorithms, this tool analyzes, processes, and transforms your image from a grid of pixels to geometrical shapes. These resulting vector images can be expanded to any resolution without losing quality, allowing for a wider range of applications, including printing, cutting, embroidering and more.A core feature of Vectorizer.AI is its deep vector engine that employs artificial intelligence networks to create thorough and precise vector conversions. It also utilizes a unique computational geometry framework, the Vector Graph, which enables automated edits and localized optimizations that are challenging to achieve with conventional vector image representations. Rather than limiting its functioning to simple Bezier curves, it fits complex geometric shapes where applicable to provide an ideal fit and unmatched consistency. It supports various types of curves and uses them as needed, providing results that are more natural than those from other vectorizers. High performance is ensured through the full utilization of state-of-the-art GPUs for deep learning, and efficient, parallel classical algorithms conducted on multi-core CPUs.Vectorizer.AI takes care of features that are less than a pixel wide and places boundaries according to the anti-aliasing pixel values. Fully automatic, it doesnt require user input to produce results, working effectively on scanner images, photos of sketches, drawn artwork, and photographs. It also supports full 32-bit color, including the alpha channel, and allows for a wide range of export options, including SVG, PDF, EPS, DXF, and PNG formats.</p>
