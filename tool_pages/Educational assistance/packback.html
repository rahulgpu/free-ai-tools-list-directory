            <h2>About Packback</h2>
            <p>Packback is an AI learning platform designed to facilitate inquiry-based discussion, writing assignments, and instructor coaching. The platform offers various AI-powered functionality elements, specifically 'Packback Questions', an award-winning student discussion platform and 'Packback Deep Dives', a feedback platform for writing assignments. Packback Questions aim to engage curiosity, build community, increase motivation, and support writing practice through AI coaching to help students improve their questioning and response skills. Packback Deep Dives, on the other hand, looks to enhance students' writing skills and confidence on written assignments by providing instant AI-powered coaching. The tool further assists in streamlining the grading process of writing assignments through a grading assistant that conforms to the user's specific rubric. One of the distinguishable features of Packback is its Instructional AI which enhances critical thinking and writing skills by providing instant feedback, thereby allowing educators to focus their attention on enhancing students' ideas. The AI does not write for students, it educates them on how to be stronger writers and critical thinkers. Packback's Instructional AI also functions as a grading assistant, handling the mechanical aspects of managing and grading assignments, hence providing more time for educators to focus on their students' content and offer meaningful, personalized feedback.</p>
