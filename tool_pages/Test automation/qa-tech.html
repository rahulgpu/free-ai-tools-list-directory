            <h2>About QA.tech</h2>
            <p>QA.tech offers an AI-driven solution aimed at improving the quality of software through automated quality assurance (QA) testing. The AI tool is designed to test web applications, creating comprehensive bug reports useful for developers. The testing process involves a continual scan of your site to create a detailed understanding of the web application and how users interact with it. From this, the QA testing agent identifies actions and objectives, which form the basis of the tests that would be set up by the users using their own credentials and data. As the tests are run as part of your development pipeline, the AI agent carries out steps to meet test objectives while multiple personas monitor varying defects' severity. The tests work in a similar fashion as manual testing conducted in a browser, providing immediate feedback. The AI also adapts dynamically to any changes on the site. Evaluation is made through detailed, actionable insights and developer-friendly bug reports which include console logs, network requests, among others, and can be exported to Linear, Jira, Clickup, etc., for further assessments. These processes allow developers to spend less time on testing and more on building new features, saving money on manual QA, reducing potential production bugs, thereby enhancing the product's quality and reducing the risk of customer loss due to bugs.</p>
