            <h2>About Testsigma</h2>
            <p>Testsigma is an AI-driven test automation tool which offers a low-code approach, enabling the creation of tests in plain English. This test automation platform is described as stable and reliable, and is claimed to significantly reduce test flakiness. Platform features include web application, mobile app, and API testing. Various use cases are supported, ranging from regression to visual testing. The platform is designed for test development and execution, reporting and analytics, test data management, and AI-driven test automation. It provides integrations, add-ons, and extensive feature coverage. Tests can be authored using Natural Language Processing (NLP), making scripting more intuitive. Testsigma also offers 'auto-healing' tests, automatically adjusting the mapping of application elements as they change. Its AI-based Suggestions Engine helps debug test failures by identifying possible root causes, and its predictive defect identification capability anticipates areas of application that may be affected by failed tests. The platform offers the option to run tests on the cloud or locally across a range of device environments. It supports continuous testing, working closely with CI/CD platforms. Testsigma delivers a unified platform that is capable of test management, authoring, execution, reporting, and advanced features such as AI suggestion engine and visual testing.</p>
