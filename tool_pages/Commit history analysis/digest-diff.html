            <h2>About Digest diff</h2>
            <p>DigestDiff is an AI-driven tool that allows users to gain insights from a codebase's commit history without accessing the actual code. By analyzing the commit history, DigestDiff creates detailed overviews that summarize the progression, collaboration, and evolution of the codebase over time. This overview includes information about the authors' contributions and the evolutionary journey of the code.With DigestDiff, users can quickly onboard new developers by providing them with a comprehensive understanding of the codebase in minutes. The tool also helps users recap their recent work by summarizing their contributions in a format suitable for standups, retrospectives, and weekly reports. This saves time and ensures accurate recall.In addition, DigestDiff facilitates the creation of release notes by leveraging the git commit history. Users can customize the writing style, tone, and length of the release notes while the AI automates the process. These release notes can be exported as markdown files for distribution.Privacy is a priority for DigestDiff, as the tool only requires read-only access to the commit history and never accesses the code. The generated overviews and release notes are not logged or saved by DigestDiff, although users have the option to export them.DigestDiff supports integration with GitHub, allowing users to fetch commit history automatically. However, there is also the option to manually submit commit history if desired.Overall, DigestDiff provides valuable insights from commit history using AI, enabling users to understand codebases, summarize their work, and create release notes efficiently and securely.</p>
