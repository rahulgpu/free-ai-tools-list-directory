            <h2>About GeniusReview</h2>
            <p>GeniusReview is an AI-powered performance review platform designed to facilitate efficient and tailored performance evaluations. Users start by entering an employee's name and selecting their role, such as Software Engineer, Product Designer, Product Manager, among others. This information is used to customize the performance review process. The next step involves ranking specific skills relevant to the chosen role. These skills include problem solving and critical thinking, programming skills, communication and collaboration, attention to detail, time management, and adaptability. Each skill is rated on a scale from 1 to 10, with the option to skip as per your requirements. Once the skill evaluation is done, users have the freedom to add personalized questions to the review. The platform provides two example questions, but users are encouraged to input their own. Further specificity can be added by providing inputs for each question.After the necessary details are inputted, GeniusReview leverages its built-in AI to generate an in-depth performance review, complete with observations and constructive feedback. Users have the ability to select the tone of the review (supportive, direct, or friendly) to adjust the language to their particular style. Additionally, the platform assures users that their input is not stored or tracked, ensuring privacy of information. Ultimately, GeniusReview is a comprehensive tool for conducting precise, customized, and efficient performance reviews.</p>
