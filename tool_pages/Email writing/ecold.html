            <h2>About eCold</h2>
            <p>eCold.ai is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool designed to personalize cold emails at scale. It stands out for its capabilities in automatically tailoring each email to an individual prospect, using information directly from the prospect's LinkedIn profile. In addition to aiding in personalization, eCold.ai is designed for ease-of-use and eliminates scalability issues often faced in large-scale email outreach. Its functionality involves generating hundreds of AI-powered sales personalizations readily for use in further email communications. eCold.ai improves the efficiency of email personalization and supports businesses in increasing their reply rates. How it works: Users upload their prospect list, either as a CSV file or a LinkedIn URL. eCold.ai then crafts personalized lines specific to each prospect. These crafted lines can be easily used in various cold email sending tools as custom variables. eCold.ai does not send out emails itself but generates personalized lines for use in other platforms. The tool also operates on a credit system, where one credit can be used to generate 6 personalized lines, or one full email per lead. While its speed of work may vary based on the volume of requests at a given time, eCold.ai generally completes bulk requests in less than a minute.</p>
